<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Samuel Gale Jr</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C46">46</a></span>[DBC] GALE, SAMUEL, lawyer and judge; b. 1783 at St Augustine (Florida), son of Samuel Gale, assistant paymaster of English forces in North America, and a Miss Wells, originally from Brattleboro, Vt; d. 15 April 1865 at Montreal, Canada East.<br /><br />      Samuel Gale came to Canada with his parents, ardent loyalists who left the United States after the American revolution. He received his early education at Quebec, where his father was secretary to Governor Robert Prescott*. He studied law in Montreal and was called to the bar on 8 March 1807.<br /><br />      An opponent of Governor Sir George Prevost*, he was critical of the latter&#8217;s actions during the War of 1812, and made veiled attacks on him in letters published in the Montreal Herald and later put together in a pamphlet entitled Nerva, or a collection of papers published in the &#8220;Montreal Herald&#8221; (1814). At the point when James Stuart* and the members representing the French Canadian majority were attacking the English judges, and particularly Judge Jonathan Sewell*, whose dismissal they sought, Nerva reminded its readers of recent events in Ireland in such a way that they could transpose them to Lower Canada. Blaming Prevost mistakenly for yielding to &#8220;factious&#8221; elements, Gale asked the authorities to take a firmer stance.<br /><br />      He served as lawyer for Lord Selkirk [Douglas*], founder of the Red River colony, when the latter had difficulties with the North West Company, and in 1815 he went west to defend his client&#8217;s interests. In 1817 he published Notices on the claims of the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company and the conduct of its adversaries (Montreal).<br /><br />      In the spring of 1828 Gale went to London and in May and June gave testimony on three occasions before the committee of the House of Commons inquiring into the government of Canada. He represented in particular the inhabitants of the Eastern Townships, who claimed their interests were harmed because French Canadians were in a majority in the House of Assembly. On their behalf he called for better highways and asked that the courts apply English law in the region, particularly in land tenure. He also requested that the Eastern Townships be better represented in the assembly and that English immigration to them be encouraged. Finally, he declared himself in favour of the union of Upper and Lower Canada.<br /><br />      On 23 Aug. 1834 Samuel Gale was appointed by Lord Aylmer [Whitworth-Aylmer*] a judge of the Court of King&#8217;s Bench at Montreal, to replace Norman Fitzgerald Uniacke*, who had resigned. In 1835 he sat temporarily at Trois-Rivières. The members of the Patriote party in the assembly protested against the appointment of the man who had testified for the bureaucrat party before the House of Commons committee in 1828, and the colonial secretary, Spring-Rice, could not refrain from writing to the governor: &#8220;At all times, but more particularly at a moment like the present, I feel it of the highest importance that no persons who can be considered as strong political partizans should be placed on the Bench of Lower Canada. . . . When I advert to the line adopted by Mr Gale before the Committee of 1828, and his connection with the measures of those times, I very much fear that he will be looked upon with distrust by a very considerable portion of the community in Canada. . . . Under those circumstances . . . I am not disposed, as at present advised, to recommend the confirmation of his appointment.&#8221; Lord Aylmer persisted, and Gale remained a judge despite fresh protests by the members of the assembly. In 1837, in a detailed judgement, Gale maintained the right of the crown to establish martial law and suspend habeas corpus.<br /><br />      As a lawyer and judge, Gale enjoyed the respect and admiration of his colleagues even if he had adversaries. He retired on 25 April 1848 because of poor health, and died at Montreal on 15 April 1865.<br /><br />J.-C.

Clarke Publishing Company, Winnipeg, Vancouver, Montreal, 1914<br /><br />Hon. Samuel Gale, one of the ablest members of the legal profession in his day, and a very prominent citizen of Montreal, died in that city on Saturday, April 15, 1865.  He was the son of a Mr. Samuel Gale who, born in Hampshire, England, came to America in 1770 as assistant paymaster to the forces.  He married there a Miss Wells, of Brattleboro, and soon after left the army, and took up his residence in the colony of New York.  During the Revolution he stood firmly by the old flag under which he had served, and was for some time imprisoned as a loyalist.  After the Revolution, he came to reside in Canada, upon an estate granted to his wife&#8217;s father by the Crown, as indemnification for the losses brought upon his as a loyalist in the Revolution.  He was subsequently secretary to Governor Prescott, whom he accompanied to England, and there assisted to defend him from the attacks made upon his administration.  While there he wrote an essay on Public Credit, addressed and submitted to Pitt.  The following is the inscription on his tombstone at Farnham, in Shefford county:<br /> <br />&#8220;Here rests Samuel Gale, Esq., formerly acting deputy paymaster general of  H. Majesty&#8217;s forces in the Southern Provinces, now the U.S. of America; subsequently Secretary to H.E. the Governor-in-chief of H.M. dominions in N.A.; Author of Essays on Public Credit, and other work, born at Kimpton Hants, England, October 14, 1748; died at Farnham, June 27, 1826.&#8221;<br /><br />Samuel Gale of this review was born at St. Augustine, East Florida, in 1783.  He was educated at Quebec, while his father was secretary, and came to study law at Montreal under Chief Justice Sewell, in 1802, having Chief Justice Rolland and Mr. Papineau as fellow students.  Mr. Gale was admitted to the bar in 1808, and ere long secured a large practice.  In 1815 he was appointed a magistrate in the Indian territories, and accompanied Lord Selkirk when he went to the northwest.  Later, when Lord Dalhousie was attacked for his Canadian administration, Mr. Gale went home as bearer of memorials from the English-speaking Lower Canadians in the townships and elsewhere, defending his lordship&#8217;s conduct.  In 1829, he became chairman of the quarter sessions, and in 1834 was raised to the bench to replace Mr. Justice Uniacke, who preferred to resign the seat on the bench to which he had just been appointed rather than come back to Montreal during the cholera, then raging here.  Judge Gale retired from the bench in 1849, forced into retirement by continued ill health and the gradual coming on of the infirmities of old age.<br /><br />He had married in 1839 a Miss Hawley, of  St. Armand West, by whom he had three daughters.  Mrs. Gale died  in  September, 1849.  Of  the daughters the only one  now  living  is Anna R. Gale, widow of  T. Sterry Hunt, of Montreal, who is mentioned elsewhere in this work; while of the other two, Agnes Logan Gale married Andrew Stuart of Quebec, a son of Chief Justice Stuart and of a very prominent family in that city, and the third became the Baroness von Friesen, who died December 10, 1875, in Berlin, Germany.<br /><br />Born of parents who had both suffered for their loyal adherence to the British Crown during the American Revolution, and educated in their views Mr. Gale was, as long as he busied himself in politics, a stanch conservative and defender of British unity and British supremacy.  He wrote a series of letters to the Montreal Herald (in those days the organ of the stoutest conservatism) over the signature of  &#8220;Nerva&#8221; which produced a strong impression on the public mind at that time; and in espousing the cause of  Lord Dalhousie and upholding the old constitution (under the title constitutionalists taken by the conservatives of that day) against the advocates of democracy or responsible government, he was but consistently pursuing the course on which he first set out.  While upon the bench he maintained in an elaborate and very able judgment the right of the Crown to establish martial law here in 1837, refusing to theorize about what abstract rights man had or ought to have, declaring simply and firmly what the law, as he read it, established the prerogative of the sovereign to be in a colony.  Both as a lawyer and judge he won the respect of his confreres alike by his ability and learning.<br /><br />For many years previous to his death he was deeply interested in the freedom of the slave.  He could not speak with patience of any compromise with slavery and waxed indignant in denunciation of all who in any way aided, abetted, or even countenanced it.  When the Anderson case was before the Upper Canada courts he was one of the most active among those who aroused agitation here.  When the Prince of Wales visited this country he got up a congratulatory address from the colored people of Canada which, however, was not received, as the prince was desired by the Duke of Newcastle, not to recognize differences of race and creed wherever it could be helped.<br /><br />Judge Gale was a man of  high principle and ever bore an unblemished moral character.  Once in his early career at the bar he was forced by the then prevailing customs of society to fight a duel.  His antagonist was Sir James Stuart, who had quarreled with him in court and Mr. Gale was severely wounded.  It was an event which, we believe, he profoundly regretted, and gladly saw the better day dawn when men ran no risk of forfeiting their position as gentlemen by refusing to shoot, or be shot at, in order to redress real or fancied insults.  He was a scrupulously just man, most methodical and punctual in business matters.  There were in his writings great care, and precision and clearness of language.  In his letters, too, and even in signing his name, the same trait was observable.  He often used to condemn the stupid custom of men who signed their names with a flourish, yet so illegibly that no one could read, but only guess at, the word intended.  He was not ostentatious of his charities, yet they were not lacking.  Some years before his demise he made a gift of  land to Bishop&#8217;s College, Lennoxville, and during the last months of  his life, when age and illness were day by day wearing him out, he found relief for his own distress in aiding to relieve that of the needy and afflicted.<br /><br />With him passed away one more of those men, who link the creative past, in which were laid the foundations of our civilization, with the bustling present and of whom the generation of today knows naught; of men more proud and precise in their manners than we are; and of such rectitude and sense of honor, that we feel deeply the loss of the influence of their example.  A loyal subject, a learned and upright judge, a kind, true, steadfast friend, was lost to the community in Judge Gale.</div>
