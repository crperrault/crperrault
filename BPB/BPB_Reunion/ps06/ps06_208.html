<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Edouard Raymond Fabre</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Patriote, qui fut emprisonné après avoir participe à la bataille de St-Denis.<br /><br />[DBC] A man of little education, who invested heavily in that of his children to secure their social advancement.  His business and political status ensured his son a childhood in the comfortable bourgeois milieu of the Cuvilliers, the  Papineaus, and the Cherriers.  He was displeased at his son's leaning toward the priesthood, but eventually told him &quot;If you are going to be a priest, you must be a distinguished priest&quot;<br /><br />[WWW Patriotes] Revenu d'un voyage à Paris en 1823, Édouard-Raymond Fabre achète le fonds de commerce de la librairie Bossange. Fabre ne tarde pas à enrichir ce modeste fonds grâce à ses bons contacts français. Par son mariage avec Luce Perrault il s'associe à une fâmeuse famille patriote. Avec le député Charles-Ovide Perrault, mais surtout avec Louis Perrault, l'associé de Fabvre jusqu'en 1835. De 1832 à 1837, la librairie de Fabre est le lieu de rassemblement des patriotes montréalais. Fabvre participe en outre à la fondation de la Maison canadienne de commerce (1832) et de la Banque du peuple (1835). En 1834, il devient trésorier de l'Union patriotique. En plus de ses tâches de trésoriers, Fabre contribue financièrement à soutenir les divers instances du mouvement patriote. <br /><br />L'engagement de Fabre est indissociable de son amitié pour Papineau. Cette fidélité restera indéfectible même des années après les Rébellions. C'est d'ailleurs Fabre, à l'heure des arrestations, qui convainquera Papineau de se réfugier aux États- Unis. Réussissant à se cacher en 1837, Fabre est finalement arrêté en décembre 1838. Après les rébellions, Fabre se dévoue à la cause des prisonniers et des exilés politiques. La renommé de sa librairie et sa réputation de gestionnaire hors-pair le désigne pour la politique municipale. En 1849, à contre-coeur, il accepte la maîrie de Montréal. Épuisé, il meurt du choléra en 1854. Il restera un des acteurs centraux de l'action patriote. Sa très grande intégrité et son dévouement à l'organisation en font un patriote de premier plan.<br /><br />[DBC] Little is known about his childhood, but it appears to have been happy. The family was not well-off, but not poor.   Petit seminaire de Montréal, 1807-12.  Became clerk at Arthur Webster's hardware store 1813-21, where he learned all aspects of business practice. <br /><br />He became friend of Hector Bossange, son of Martin, a famous parisian bookseller.  Hector opened a branch of the Bossange bookstore in Montréal in 1815 and in 1816 married Julie Fabre, ER's sister.    Fabre went to Paris in 1822, where he spent a year working in Galeries Bossange.   He learned about the complex financial, commercial and cultural aspects of the trade he would take up in Montréal.  He would become the first real bookseller in Lower Canada.<br /><br />Back in Montréal in 1823, he bought the goodwill of a bookstore that had belonged to Bossange and been acquired by Theophile Dufort in 1819.  From 1823-8, the store was known as Librairie Francaise or Librairie E-R Fabre.  Because of difficulties in choosing stock for his clientele, he terminated the special relations he had maintained with the Bossange firm and went into partnership with his brother-in- law Louis Perrault in 1828.  They did business under the name Librairie Fabre et Perrault until 1835.  Perrault went to Paris as an agent of the firm.  After the dissolution of their partnership in 1835, it reverted to its name of Librairie Francaise or Librairie E-R Fabre.  <br /><br />That year he took on as a partner Jean Adolphe Gravel, the son of his sister Sophie.  The bookstore was in a building at the corner of St- Vincent and Notre-Dame streets, owned by the Perrault family, but bought by Fabre in 1844.  <br /><br />Fabre's clientele consisted of members of the clergy and liberal profesions, teeachers, students and businessmen.  The catalogues show the predominance of and progression of religious works, and a decline in literary and philosophical works.  The increase in the quantity of pedagogical texts. linked to the great strides being made in primary education, was a major factor in the develpment of Fabre's business.  This increase occurred at the expense of jurisprudence, history, politics and technical subjects and trades.  The first catalogues showed a wide range of theoretical and practical manuals for 38 trades, but these had disappeared by 1855. <br /><br />Until 1843, when Fabre visited Paris, his firm also sold paperworks and school supplies and objects of worship.  After 1843, he added luxury goods, including perfume, shoes, umbrellas, suspenders, champagne, absinthe, and gruyere cheese.  During his partnership with Perrault, he published at least 5 titles a year.  <br /><br />The company's operations as a whole ensured Fabre's financial success.  As a businessman he showed himself able to adapt to changing circumstances concerning power and resources.  He knew how to turn to account the rising forces of conservatism and clericalisation.  <br /><br />By 1827, he was moving in Montréal Patriote circles with C.O. Perrault.  He became involved in the general election of 1827 and in the mission of Viger, Neilson and CUvillier to ENgland in 1828.  He was soon strongly influencing the public figures and his offices became one of their regular meeting places.  In 1832, he was a founding member of the Maison du Commerce (with Cherrier, PD Larocque, D Mondelet and PD Debartsch) whose aim was to draw FCs into business circles and set up warehouses for imported goods which would allow them to be in business without having to resort to British houses.  In 1834, he signed the act of association for the creation of the Banque du Peuple (with LM Viger, J DeWitt and Jos Roy);  he was treasurer for the banq and received subscriptions when it opened in 1835.  In 1835 he took part in the ofunding of the Union Patriotique de Montréal (w/ DB Viger, DeWitt, Roy, AN Morin, EB O'Callaghan, L Asselin and A Ouimet) to spread knowledge, obtain responsible govmt, improve communications, secure prompt and cheap administration of justice and oppose undue interference of the Colonial and War Offices.  The goals were exactly those of the Patriote Party as set out in 1834.  In 1835 he was also a member of a group that owned the steamship &quot;Le Patriote&quot;, and as sec-treas and member of exec comm.  He was one of the most active organizers of the SSJB in Montréal.  <br /><br />He supported Duvernay's &quot;La Minerve&quot;  and helped Duvernay by launching a fund-raising campaign on his behalf when he was imprisoned for libel in 1836.  He purchased the Vindicator in 1832.  <br /><br />He had unbounded admiration for Papineau and served as his advisor.  He was elected a delagate at the 15-5-1837 mtg in St-Laurent, a sort of Estates General for the movement.  He chaired the protest mtg in Montréal 28-6-37 where Papineau launched the insurrectionnary movement.  <br /><br />A few hours before the outbreak of the rebellion on 23-11-1837 in St- Denis, he persuaded Papineau and O'Callaghan to flee to the US.  He himself did not leave, but hid for 7 months in COntrecoeur, Lavaltrie or neighboring villages.  He was upset by his wife's health following a miscarriage and CO Perrault's death at St-Denis.  He was arrested in Mtl 12-12-1838, but released a month later for lack of evidence.   It is amazing that he was not arrested earlier -- his imprisonment may finally be due to the planned invasion of Canada by Robert Nelson and CHO Cote.  <br /><br />He worked tirelessly to provide for the exiled patriotes and assure their return.  He visited Papineau in paris in 1843 and founded the Association de la Deliverance in Dec 1843.  By 1846 they were all back in the homeland.  <br /><br />After Papineau returned in 1845, Fabre pressed him to run for election, which he did in 1848, in the election that brought the fall of DB Viger's government and the comeback of LH Lafontaine.  He had little influence n his return.  <br /><br />La Minerve did not approve Papineau's radicalism, but it was supported by L'Avenir, the organ of l'Institut Canadien.  L'Avenir clashed with Melanges Religieux, the unofficial organ of the diocese of Mtl.  Fabre had backed l'Avenir but severed his ties and in 1-1852 started Le Pays with Jacques-Alexis Pinguet.  This moderating intervention in the liberal ress was probably related to the need to pay attention to the growing importance of the clergy to his bookstore business.<br /><br />In 1848 he turned to municipal politics and was elected councillor for the East Ward and member of the finance committee.  In 1849 he was elected mayor.  He worked to reorganize the city's finances under extremely difficult economic circumstances.  He got the council to adopt measure to suppress the riots that had led to the burnig down of the parliament bldgs in Mtl after the passing of the Rebellion Losses Act.  He applied himself to protective and preventative measures against cholera epidemic in the city that year. He was reelected by acclamation in 1850, against his own wishes.  He was also elected Pres of SSJB in 1850.  <br /><br />In 1854 he ran for mayor again against Wolfred Nelson, in an extremely violent campaign.  He failed and was stricken with cholera on 11-7-1854 and died 5 days later.  <br /><br />[DBC, Mgr Fabre] A man of little education, who invested heavily in that of his children to secure their social advancement.  His business and political status ensured his son a childhood in the comfortable bourgeois milieu of the Cuvilliers, the  Papineaus, and the Cherriers.
