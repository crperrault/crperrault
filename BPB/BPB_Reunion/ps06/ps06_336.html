<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Alexander Fraser</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C108">108</a></span> Alexander Fraser of Beauchamp &nbsp;(c1729-1799) <br /><br />According to the&nbsp; Dictionary of Canadian Biography , Vol. 4 (p. 276): &nbsp;Untangling the several Alexander Frasers who served with the 78th Foot in the campaigns of the Seven Years&#8217; War has been a perennial problem. <br /><br />&#8220;This Alexander Fraser was commissioned Lieutenant 12 Feb 1757, wounded at the battle of the Plains of Abraham on 13 Sept 1759 and Ste-Foy in April 1760.&nbsp;&nbsp; He remained in Canada when the regiment was disbanded in 1763 and purchased from Brig-General James Murray, the seigneury of La Martinière, later acquiring other property.&nbsp;&nbsp; About 1765 he married Jane McCord, who died in 1767, leaving him to raise two infant daughters, Margaret and Jane...&quot; <br /><br />According to the Army List [War Office, 4th of June, 1779], John Nairne, Alex. Fraser and Malcolm Fraser were commissioned Captains 14 June 1775 in the 84th Regiment of Foot, or Royal Highland Emigrants, 1st Battalion, America; with John Nairne promoted Major 29 Aug 1777. &nbsp;&nbsp; The Royal Highland Emigrants were placed on the British regular establishment as the 84th Foot on 1 April 1779.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander Fraser, late Captain in His Majesty&#8217;s 84th Regiment of Foot, died at St-Charles on the nineteenth instant, aged about seventy years, and was buried at Quebec St. Andrew&#8217;s on 22nd April 1799. <br /><br />His daughter Margaret Fraser (c.1766-1807) married John Reid (1765-1827), without issue.&nbsp; Jane Fraser (c.1767-1790) married Arthur Davidson (1743-1807), with issue: Jane, born 10 Dec and baptized 23 Dec 1785; Eliza, born 16 Apr and baptized&nbsp; 1 May 1787; and Walter, born&nbsp; 7 Aug and baptized &nbsp;26 Aug 1790. &nbsp;In 1799 Arthur Davidson married secondly, Eleanor Birnie (1756-1837), who survived him and, after 30 years in Montreal, she returned dutifully but unwillingly in 1822 to be a companion to her two elderly sisters in Ballymena, Ireland, where she died. <br /><br />On 25 June 1791 Alexander Fraser gifted the land and seigneury of St. Giles to his grandson, Walter Davidson, then aged ten months, in the presence of Arthur Davidson.&nbsp;&nbsp; Walter Davidson (1790-1825) was 30 years old at the time of the Marriage Contract dated 25 April 1820 with Ann Bernie of Ballymena, Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the terms of the gift from his grandfather, Walter had to wait until age 40 before taking possession of the seigneury of St. Giles of Beaurivage.&nbsp;&nbsp; If he died before and without issue, the property would revert to his sisters or the survivor of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; When Walter died in Glasgow 13 May 1825, without issue, the survivor was Jane Davidson (1785-1866), married to David Ross (1770-1837). <br /><br />Alexander Fraser&#8217;s ancestry is unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is a curious clause in the last will and Testament of Alexander Fraser of Beauchamp in the Province and district of Quebec County of Hartford in Lower Canada, dated 27 June 1798 and probated 7 April 1800, respecting all his lands and real estate in the Parishes of St. Joseph, St. Charles, St. Gervais, St. Giles, Houses 5, 6 &amp; 7 on Rampart Street in Quebec, etc... <br /><br />Failing the lawful issue of his own Body… [spelling not corrected]: <br />&#8220;Then I give and devise the said Estat&#8217;s, To Alexander Fraser Esqr of Strichen (son to ye late Lord Strichen of North Britain), for and during his natural life and after his decise, Then I give and devise my said Estat&#8217;s to the heirs of the Body of the said Alexr Fraser lawfully issueing, The Youngest Daughter if such their be, alwise preferd, and the heirs of her Body lawfully issueing, and in default of such issue, or Daughters, Then I give and devise, my said Estat&#8217;s to the Youngest Son of the said Alexr Fraser, and the heirs of his Body lawfully issueing, and in default of such issue, The said Estat&#8217;s to go in the family, the Youngest alwise preferd ~… &#8220;Executors: John McCord, the Rev. Alexander Sparks, Peter Stuart Esqr and Colonel John Nairne. Witnesses: William Napier, John McLoughlin Junior and Remi Quirouét.&quot; <br /><br />It is not practical, in this article, to speculate on the family connection to Alexander Fraser, 7th Strichen (c.1699-1775) who married Lady Ann Campbell (d/o of Archibald, 10th Earl &amp; 1st Duke of Argyll), first cousin to Primrose Campbell, Lady Lovat. &nbsp;Lord Strichen was succeeded by his son, Alexander Fraser, 8th Strichen (c.1733-1794) who had several children by his wife, Jean Menzies who died in Aberdeen in 1798, only child of William Menzies, St. Ann&#8217;s, Jamaica. &nbsp;&nbsp; Alexander Fraser, 9th Strichen (1765-1803), died ten months after the birth of his only child, Thomas Alexander Fraser, 10th Strichen, later 14th Lord Lovat (1802-1875).</div>
