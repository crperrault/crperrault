<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Pierre Gauthier De Boumois De La Vérendrye</div>

<div class="psNotesData">[Sulte]  Explorateur du Nord Ouest.  Dit de Varennes<br /><br />[Jette] enseigne en 1712 au Canada.  Heritier du fief du Tremblay au partage de 7-7-1707.<br /><br />[DBC] Pierre's early career in the army in France and Canada was generally unsuccessful  and after marrying in 1712, he spent 15 years eking out a living on his estate at Ile aux Vaches.  <br /><br />By 1728, he had joined his brother Jacques-René in a fur-trading partnership with posts in Kamininistiquia (Thunder Bay ON), Nipigon, and Michipicoton (N of Sault Ste Marie).  Here he got the idea of looking for the western sea by reaching a gulf-like western sea opening on the Pacific.   He was chasing a mirage.  Based on conversations with Indians he met on his travels, he convinced himself that the western sea was not in the area of the Manitoba lakes but to the west.   He saw Lake Winnipeg not as the nub of a complex set of waterwys but as an enlargement of the River of the West.  <br /><br />The seed of the failure of La Verendrye's explorations lay partly in the financial arrangements.  The crown refused to contribute much support, fearing that the expedition was merely an excuse for development of commerce.  The merchants on whom LV had to rely (LV's son Jean-Baptiste, his nephew Christophe Dufrost de La Jemerais, and the merchants Louis Hamelin, Laurent-Eustache Gamelin Chateauvieux, and Ignace Gamelin Jr.) had no interest in exploration.  <br /><br />In June 1731, LV set out from Montréal and reached the western extremity of Lake Superior in August and Rainy Lake in the autumn.  He wintered in Kaministiquia and moved on to Lake of the Woods in spring 1732 where he built Fort St-Charles which served as his headquarters for the next several years.  He sent his son JB to Montréal to seek further support from the crown.  Based on weather patterns at Lake of the Woods, he inferred that the sea was nearby.  On the basis of Indian reports only, he diverted his search from the Canadian plains to the Mississippi basis.  This diversion was a fundamental error that took eight years to discover.  <br /><br />In May 1734, LV started for Montréal where he found that his associates would give him no more credit.  Beauharnois informed him that the king was unwilling to contribute to the enterprise, but otherwise had no intention of abandonning LV.   The solution was for LV to farm out his posts to his business associates in return for an annual salary of 3000 livres.  A new association was formed, dominated by JB Bigras and JM Nolan, a younger brother of Charles Nolan Lamarque, one of Montréal'smost important merchants.<br /><br />In June 1735, LV set out for the west and arrived at Fort St-Charles in October, where he found the situation was quite bad -- La Jemerais had died, the posts were not provisioned, and several memebrs of the expedition, including one of his sons, died at the hand of the Sioux. He finally reached Lake Winnipeg in Feb 1737, and would have continued searching for the Mandans, but his men refused to follow him.  The voyage, however, had enebled him to understand the complicated Manitoba lakes system andhow it related to the western sea.  A map drawn by Louis-Joseph in 1737 shows two possibilities for reaching the ocean:  one, which would be attempted first, was to pass SW to the Mandan country.  The other was to use the Saskatchewan River (or Riviere blanche).  According to Indian reports, this Riv. Blanche connected with a westward flowing river by means of a lake lying on a height of land.  <br /><br />LV received a cool reception when he reached Québec in the fall of 1737. Maurepas was pressing for exploration, not commerce, but Beauharnois also attached great importance to the commercial aspects. The forts established west of Lake Superior had been spectacualrly successful in 1735, generating over half of the beaver crop for that year.  But to mollify Maurepas, Beauharnois got LV to promise that he would reach the Mandans in 1738, and told the merchants that the needed to cooperate.  <br /><br />Indian slaves were routinely taken in the west.  <br /><br />LV reached Fort Maurepas on 22  Sep 1738.  On 3 Oct he was at Portage- la-Prairie, and on 16 Oct he set off  for the Mandans which he reached on 3 Dec.  This was near Sanish, North Dakota, near the upper waters of either the Little Knife River or Shell Creek.  At last he stood, he thought, within a few miles of the famous River of the West.  Strangely, he did not trouble himself to make the rest of the journey, sending his son Louis Joseph instead.  LJ took his bearings at a point where the Missouri turns sharply to the SW.  Had high bluffs not blocked his view downstream, he could have seen the Missouri resuming its normal SE flow and probably lost any illusion about its beign the River of the West.  <br /><br />The journey had left LV exhausted and burdened with debt.  He never afterward displayed the fortitude and stamina of his early days.   (He was 55).  In June 1740 he travelled to Montréal to learn that his wife Anne had died.  Beauharnois was gracious to him and tried to help him place his finances in better order.  In 1741, he set out on his 4th and last voyage west.  <br /><br />TO see if the sea could be reached by the SW route, he sent Louis Joseph on the memorable journey that took him in 1742-3 as far as the Big Horn mountains of Wyoming.  He built several forts on the Manitoba lakes.  THey were celarly aimed at trade, which probably further discredited him with Maurepas, who now regarded his every gesture with suspicion.  In 1742, he informed Beauharnois that LV's enterprise might show better results if some suitable officer, whom M would pay, were associated with him.  Maurepas was celarly intent on squeezing LV out of the west.  Seeing the sign on the wall, alleging ill health, LV handed in his resignation in 1743, effective the next year.  <br /><br />But thanks to Beauharnois's loyalty, his links to the west were not severed.  Nicolas Joseph Noyelles de Fleurimont who succeeded him as commandant was married to one of his nieces, his osns remained at their posts, and he continued to carry on sizable trade thanks to premits issued to him by Beauharnois and his successor.  He received a captain's commission in 1744 and was named captain of the guards.   He settled down to the good life, in Québec's fashionable society.  In 1746, Noyelles resigned his command and LV was appoitned to succeed him and began planning another expedition, this time up the Saskatchewan River.  He planned to leave in 1750, but died in Dec 1749, having just been made Chevalier de St-Louis.   He left a small estate.</div>
