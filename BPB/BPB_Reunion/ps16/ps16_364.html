<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Paul Gabriel Vien</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><b>Photo <a href="http://voluntas.ca/obit/necrologie--obituaries/vien-paul-gabriel-1934-2014.html">http://voluntas.ca/obit/necrologie--obituaries/vien-paul-gabriel-1934-2014.html</a><br /><br />[Obit, Globe and Mail 14-04-12]<br /><br />VIEN, Paul Gabriel</b> (1934-2014)<br /><br />After a short illness, Paul G. Vien passed away on April 11, 2014. He was the youngest son of the late Senator Thomas Vien and the late Anna Dionne<br />He leaves to mourn his wife of 54 years, Françoise Beaubien, and his three children, Thomas (Donna Byrne), Nicole and Patrick (Sharon Lavon). He was the dear 'grand-papa Paulo' to Clarice, Mélanie, Philippe, Karina, Lukas and Klara. <br />He was the brother of the late Georgette (the late Robert Major), the late Jean, the late Madeleine (the late André Bachand), the late Michel (the late Marie-Louise), Louise Vien Mauffette, his brother Raymond (Madeleine Demers), Hélène and Thérèse (André Clermont). His Beaubien in-laws were also very dear to him: Philippe (Nan-B), Josette, Louise, Lucile, Jean (Huguette), Michèle (Gilles) and Paul (Lise). Many nephews and nieces will always remember 'mon oncle Paulo'.<br />He was a graduate of HEC, his alma mater, to which he always remained faithful. He pursued a distinguished career in the world of finance, first at René T. Leclerc in 1959, then at Nesbitt Thomson, from 1966 to 1978, where he left behind an important legacy. In 1978, he chose to pursue a career as an entrepreneur in the world of media, and he founded the Pathonic Network, which operated television stations in the regions of Québec, Sherbrooke, Trois-Rivières and Rimouski. In 1990, he returned to his first love and, with his colleague, J. Brian Aune, founded St. James Financial Corporation, where he enjoyed meeting young entrepreneurs seeking his advice and expertise. He retired at the age of 70.<br />He served on several boards of directors, including that of Auberge des Gouverneurs, Mitel Corporation and Aviva Insurance Company.<br />For many years, Paul was passionate about sailing, before transferring that enthusiasm to golfing. He was also a very generous philanthropist, sponsoring mostly the field of education, his alma mater, as well as the field of mental health, cancer research, and services for young people with type 1 diabetes. <br />Those who knew him will always remember his great strength of character, his integrity, his generosity and his love for those close to him. The family wishes to thank Dr. Michel Émond for his dedication and his attention towards his long-standing patient. They further thank the Oncology team at Hôpital Notre-Dame de Montréal (CHUM), Dr. Normand Blais, Dr. Louise Yelle, as well as all the nursing staff, which should be commended for their outstanding attention and commitment. The family also wishes to express their gratitude to the staff of the West Island Palliative Care Residence, especially Teresa, Rose and Dr. Geneviève Richer, for their dedication, their compassionate approach, and all the excellent care. <br />The family will receive relatives and friends on Wednesday, April 16, 2014, from 10 a.m., at St-Edmund of Canterbury Church, 105 Beaconsfield Boulevard, in Beaconsfield, followed by a funeral service at 11 a.m. Following the church ceremony, Françoise and her children will welcome you at the Forest and Stream Club, 1800 Lakeshore Road in Dorval (West of Pine Beach Boulevard) to commemorate Paul's life. <br />Your sympathy can be expressed by a memorial donation to the West Island Palliative Care Residence, 265 André-Brunet Street, Kirkland, Québec, H9H 3R4, (514) 693-1718, or on line at <a href="http://www.wipcr.ca/"><u><font color="#0000e9">www.wipcr.ca</a></font></u>.</div>
