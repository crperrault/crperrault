<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1577">1577</a></span> Only son<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1577">1577</a></span> From Robert Stuart Sanders, Robert Stuart book, &quot;Apparently, John married someone who his father did not approve of, because Elizabeth was a &quot;commoner.&quot; When his father died intestate in 1782, John had to prove his right to the inheritance.&quot;<br /><br />From &quot;Historic Families of Kentucky,&quot; by Thomas Marshall Green, originally published Cincinnati, 1889, reprinted for Clearfield Co., by Genealogical Publishing Co., Baltimore, 1996, p. 221-222:<br /><br />&quot;Some time after 1740, Archibald Stuart was followed to the valley (Augusta Co., Virginia) by two younger brothers, John and David. The latter was the ancestor of the Stuarts of So. Carolina. The former, John Stuart, must not be confounded with the John Stuart who came over with Dinwiddie, married widow Paul (Jane Linn), and was the father of Col. John Stuart of Greenbrier. The men were different, the families in this country distinct. The John Stuart to whom reference is now made, settled in Augusta Co. in what is now Rockbridge, was a member of Timber Ridge congregation, and married a Miss Walker, of the Rutherford-Allienne-Walker family - the family of preaching talents - of Walker's Creek. Many of his descendants still live in that vicinity. One of the sons of this John Stuart and Miss Walker, Robert Stuart - was born on Walker's Creek, August 14, 1772.&quot;<br /><br />From Emma Siggins White, &quot;Descendants of John Walker of Wigton,&quot; 1902, p.52:<br /><br />&quot;John Stuart, only child of his parents, was born 1740 and succeeded to the estate of his father. He married Elizabeth Walker (daughter of James and granddaughter of John, the emigrant) and lived and died on Walker's Creek. During the Revolutionary War he served as a soldier and at the Battle of Guilford was an officer. According to family tradition he visited Ireland in 1786 and brought back a considerable sum of money. He died 1831, fully 90 years old. He was for many years a member of the Timber Ridge Ch. of Augusta Co., Va., now Rockbridge Co.&quot;<br /><br />From CHRONICLES OF THE Scotch-Irish Settlement IN VIRGINIA EXTRACTED FROM THE ORIGINAL COURT RECORDS OF AUGUSTA COUNTY 1745-1800 RECORD BOOKS IN CIRCUIT COURT OFFICE. BOOK MARKED &quot;RECORDS.&quot; page 267 Page 114--John Stuart, aged 65, deposes, same time and place. Executors of Borden, Jr., conveyed 230 acres to Robert McElrath. Deponent says that Moses Edmonson was first settler on the tract, which was several years after death of Borden, Jr. Moses sold to Mathew Moorehead, who sold to Jno. McElrath who is the same as Robt. McElrath. Borden, Jr., conveyed 313 acres to John Stuart, father of deponent. Deed recorded in Augusta. It was bought from Benj., Sr.<br /><br /><br />Page ___--John Stewart deposes, 26th April, 1806, aged 67 or 68 years. Has lived in Borden's grant since 1748 or 1749; is son-in-law of James Walker<br /><br /><br />In an e-mail of July 14, 1999, Tom P. Smith writes, &quot;My ancestor, John Stuart who married Elizabeth Walker used to boast that there wasn't a Tory in the whole family, so says family tradition.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Rockbridge County, VA--Personal Property Taxes, 1783; (from <a href="ftp://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/va/rockbridge/census/tax1783.txt">ftp://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/va/rockbridge/census/tax1783.txt</a>) These property tax records have been extracted from the original records in the Clerk of Circuit Court Office in Lexington, VA. Categories: free white males, slaves above 16, slaves age 12-16, horses and cows. John Stuart 1-1-2-11-17<br /><br />From George West Diehl, &quot;ROCKBRIDGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA NOTEBOOK&quot; COMPILED FROM ARTICLES BY DR. GEORGE W. DIEHL AS PUBLISHED IN THE NEWS-GAZETTE, LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA. (found in <a href="http://justcallbob.com/images/rockbridge.html">http://justcallbob.com/images/rockbridge.html</a>)<br /><br />&quot;In his lifetime, Benjamin Borden, Jr., sold 318 acres to James Greenlee. The property cornered on the lands of John Davidson, a certain Cahoon, and a McClure. It was not until March 17, 1757, that Archibald Alexander and Magdalen McDowell Bowyer, acting as executors of the Borden estate, gave the deed. The tract was sold to James Davis, who disposed of it to Abraham Rhodes. In 1805 Rhodes sold it to Dickey Beard. The Borden heirs had a suit over the tract with Greenlee, but Greenlee&#8217;s title was confirmed. Noe Beard entered suit for a deed from Rhodes who had moved to Highland County, Ohio and won his case. Another real estate tangle resulted from the sale of 230 acres by the executors of Borden to Robert McElrath. Moses Edmonson had made a settlement on the tract and was the first; this was a few years after the death of Benjamin Borden, Jr. Edmonson sold the place to a Matthew Moorehead who disposed of it to McElrath. A suit was entered to get the deed corrected and established. A witness in the case was John Stuart, who was now a man of sixty-five. His father, John Stuart, had bought 313 acres from Borden, Jr. The deposition was taken at Brownsburg in July, 1805.&quot;<br /><br /><br />    1. James STUART b: ABT. 1762<br />    2.
