Burton to Rev Christian  Denissen&#8221;<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C280">280</a></span> {Frank Beaubien] He and his family moved to Chicago in 1827.  Mark got a license on Jun 8, 1830 to keep tavern at te Sauganash, which he named after Billy Caldwell, whose Indian name it was.  The Sauganash Hotel, at the corner of Lake and Market Streets, was the first frame building in Chicago.  In the spring of 1834, he sold the tavern to John Murphy.  Beaubien bought a brick house on the NW corner of Lake and Wells from Archibald Steele, which was the first brick house in Chicago.  He then moved to Kishwaukee, near Rockford, but returned to Chicago in 1840.  He finally traded his house for a farm of 260 acres at Naperville, IL, where he kept tavern and toll-gate for the Chicago Plankroad in 1841.  He returned to Chicago in 1854 and was appointed lighthouse keeper, position he kept until 1858, when he returned to his naperville farm.  He returned to Chicago in 1862, and kept the Fort Dearborn Hotel on River Street near Rush St. Bridge.  He played the violin. <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C245">245</a></span> [Thompson] Mark undoubtedly tood the lead in helping secure the Priest (Fr. St-Cyr) and establish the first church.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C283">283</a></span>Beaubien, Mark  (1800-1881) born in Detroit, younger brother of [see] Jean Baptiste; married Monique Nadeau (1800-1847), with whom he had 16 children, 14 of whom survived their mother; then married Elizabeth Mathieu, with whom he had seven. Mark came to Chicago in 1826 with Monique and children, among them [see] Emily, and purchased a small log cabin on the south bank near the Forks from James Kinzie; in 1829 he began to take in guests, calling his cabin the &quot;Eagle Exchange Tavern.&quot; A fun-loving fiddle player, he loved to entertain his guests at night, tempting one to believe stories about his knack for boyish mischief [see following excerpts from Hurlbut]; was licensed to keep a tavern on June 9, 1830; when the town plat was published that year, he found that his business was in the middle of a street and moved the structure to the SE corner of Market and Lake streets. He purchased from the government in 1830 lots 3 and 4 in block 31 on which his building stood, as well as the small block 30, later selling part of the land to Charles A. Ballard [see Maps, 1834, John S. Wright]. In 1831 he built on a two-story frame house and called the structure the &quot;Sauganash Hotel&quot; in honor of his friend Billy Caldwell, whose Indian name was Sauganash; on June 6 that year, at the new county seat (Chicago), was granted a license to sell goods in Cook County In the late summer of 1832, he rented his original log cabin, adjacent to his tavern, to newly arrived Philo Carpenter for use as - Chicago`s 1st - drugstore; an ardent enemy of alcohol, Carpenter soon moved out. Mark next let the space to John S. Wright, and in 1833, the cabin became a school under Eliza Chappel`s direction. Early in August 1833, Mark was one of the &quot;Qualified Electors&quot; who voted to incorporate the town [for a copy of that meeting`s original report, see incorporation] and on August 10 voted in the first town election; also became the first licensed ferry owner and in 1834, built his second hotel, the &quot;Exchange Coffee House,&quot; at the NW corner of Lake and Wells streets; placed an ad in the Dec. 21, 1835, Chicago Democrat that read: &quot;I Mark Beaubien, do agree to pay 25 bushels of Oats if any man will agree to pay me the same number of bushels if I win against any man`s horse or mare in the town of Chicago, against Maj. R.A. Forsyth`s bay mare, Now in Town for three miles on the ice&quot;; 1839 City Directory: hotel-keeper, Lake Street. In 1840, Mark removed to Lisle with his family where he acquired farmland from William Sweet S of Sweet`s Grove and also a cabin located immediately W of the [see] Beaubien Cemetery; the cabin soon became a tavern, while yet home to the residing family. From 1851 to 1857 he used the building as a toll station for the Southwest Plank Road, with his son collecting the toll; the structure, built in the 1830s, still exists though moved [see Monuments]. Later, during 1859 and 1860, he was the lighthouse keeper in Chicago. His address in 1878 was Newark, Kendall County. During the last 10 years of his life, he was troubled by failing memory, much to his chagrin because he loved to tell stories of the past; he was happiest in the company of old friends. Mark died on April 11, 1881, in the home of his daughter Mary [born Sept. 30, 1848] and son-in-law, Georges Mathieu, at Kankakee and was buried with his second wife in St. Rose Cemetery, the oldest portion of Mound Grove. His fiddle is preserved at the Chicago Historical Society. One of his sons, Napoleon, known as &quot;Monkey,&quot; was a close childhood friend of Edwin O. Gale; another son Mark, Jr., lived in Chicago well into the 20th century; street name: Beaubien Court (120 E from 150 N to 186 N), a short street in present downtown Chicago, named after Mark and Jean Baptiste Beaubien who together fathered 42 children with their Indian, French and English wives, vitally contributing to the population explosion of early Chicago. [42, 160, 357, 266, 429 ]<br />[Chicago Antiquities, p.332] ...We have read a statement in Smith`s History of Wisconsin to the purport that Col. Wm. J. Hamilton passed through Chicago in June, 1825 [if true, it must have been 1826; eds.], with a drove of some 700 head of cattle, procured in southern Illinois, which he had contracted to the government, for the use of the post at Green Bay. A brother of Colonel Beaubien, it is stated, assisted in getting the cattle across the Chicago River, but in rendering that service, managed to drown one of them purposely; so Beaubien told Hamilton some years afterward. He did it, he said, in order to buy the animal, knowing that he could not purchase it any other way, and he very greatly needed the beef. This &quot;brother of Colonel Beaubien,&quot; we must believe, was none other than our famed Mark.<br />[p. 333] ... In the early days, while Mr. B. kept a tavern, possibly the old Sauganash, when emigration from the east began to pour forth the stream which has not yet subsided, Mark`s loft, capable of storing half a hundred men, for a night, if closely packed, was often filled to repletion. The furniture equipment, however, for a caravansary so well patronized, it is said, was exceedingly scant; that circumstance, however, only served to exhibit more clearly the eminent skill of the landlord. With the early shades of an autumn eve, the first to men arriving were given a bed on the floor of the staging or loft, and, covering them with two blankets, Mark bade them a hearty good-night. Fatigued with the day`s travel, they would soon be sound asleep, when two more would be placed by their side, and the aforesaid &quot;two blankets&quot; be drawn over these new comers. The first two were journeying too intently in the land of dreams to notice this sleight of hand feat of the jolly Mark, and as travelers, in those days, usually slept in their clothes, they generally passed the night without great discomfort. As others arrived, the last going to bed always had the blankets; and so it was, that forty dusty, hopeful, tired, and generally uncomplaining emigrants or adventurous explorers, who went up a ladder, two by two, to Mark Beaubien`s sleeping loft, were all covered with one pair of blankets. It is true, it was sometimes said, that in a frosty morning there were frequently charges of blanket-stealing, and grumbling was heard, coupled with rough words similar to those formerly used by the army in Flanders; but the great heart of Mark was sufficient for the occasion, for, at such times, he would only charge half price for lodging to those who were disposed to complain.<br /><br />Frank G. Beaubien [1919] provides a valuable late episode:<br />Near the time of my father`s death - just before he died he asked for his violin. He played an old Indian tune, the words are, &quot;Let me go to my home on the far distant shore white man, let me go.&quot; He played it partly through but he was too weak to finish. He requested me to bring the violin and a picture of Hon. John Wentworth, taken when he was a young man and to hand them to John Wentworth. After his death I brought them to Hon. John Wentworth who was stopping at the Sherman House. I handed them to him and said that it was father`s request. He took my hand, the tears came to his eyes and he could not speak and he left me and I went out deeply impressed. Mr. Wentworth gave the violin to the Calumet Club, where the old pioneers used to meet once a year until they all passed away.
