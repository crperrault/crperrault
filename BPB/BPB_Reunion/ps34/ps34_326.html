<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Benjamin Gilpin</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C26">26</a></span>  There is only one marriage of a Benjamin Gilpin to a Margaret shown 1680-1710, on 4 Jun 1700.  It not shown in non-conformist records.  Both spouses are of Strickland Roger.<br /><br />The only child for which there is a birth record is Robert, the eldest.  His birth date is given as March 1700, which is a few months before the date of the given marriage of his parents.  All other ch are known only from their marriages or burials. <br /><br />The Benjamin of Strickland Roger was clearly a Quaker, from the permit he received in 1714/5 to hold prayer services.  <br /><br />There are records for death of Benjamin in Kendal 17 Feb 1726 and 20 Sep 1730 (both non-conformist).  Benjamin&#8217;s will is dated 25 Nov 1726 and probate date is 17 Apr 1727.  It is likely that death was really in feb 1727 (i.e. that death is 1726/1727). meaning that his will was written 4 months before his death, and probated 2 months later.  The Benjamin who d 1730 was probably the son of James and Jane.  [Check all this for shift in Quaker calendar]<br /><br />If Benjamin was m in 1700, he would be born before 1682.  He might have been born a Quaker, but might have become one later.  Check state of Quaker records before 1685. <br /><br />British History Online on Strickland Roger<br /><br /><a href="http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49291">http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49291</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/thelakes/html/lgaz/lk11402.htm">http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/thelakes/html/lgaz/lk11402.htm</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/thelakes/html/lgaz/lk01928.htm">http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/thelakes/html/lgaz/lk01928.htm</a><br /><br />1714/1715 Quakers meet at Benjamin Gilpin&#8217;s house at Strickland Roger<br /><a href="http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49358">http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49358</a><br /><b>1714/15</b> 14 January.

To my supervisors five shillings.<br />Probate: 17-Apr-1727<br /><br />[CRP] This is quite likely the will of our James&#8217; father. Skelsmergh and Strickland Roger are less than 3m apart.  Evidence for all the ch have been found, though no birth records for most.  Those who married did so after the will. Edward Walker is likely the brother of Benjamin Gilpin&#8217;s wife Margaret, both ch of John and Margaret Walker (nee Walker).  John Walker&#8217;s father is also Edward.  There is a George Bateman who is contemporary of Benjamin&#8217;s but I cannot find a link from him to either Gilpins or Walkers.  Mark Walker (&#8220;my son&#8221;) is not the husband of any of his daughters;  he could be another br of Margaret&#8217;s, but why would he not be called &#8220;brother&#8221; like Edward?  Could Margaret Walker have been widowed, and this be her son?  In this case Walker would not be her maiden name.<br /><br />[CRP] If Benjamin is following standard naming patterns, and his will names all his children, then his father would be Robert (known to be eldest son), and his wife&#8217;s father would be James, which does not fit current assignment to Margaret Walker&#8217;s father.  Also, Benjamin&#8217;s mother would be Elizabeth.  <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1974">1974</a></span> [will p 83]  <br /><br />[CRP] on finding earlier wills.
