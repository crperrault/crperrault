It may be stated that he makes mention of the fact that Thomas Gilpin, the eminent Minsiter of the Society of Friends, was a son of Thomas Gilpin of Mill Hill, but does not state he was descended from Bernard and Dorothy (Airy) Gilpin.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It has been stated by Joshua Gilpin, and accepted apparently without inquiry by William Jackson, F. S. A., and the error repeated by numerous writers since, that Thomas Gilpin of Mill Hill was the son of Bernard and Dorothy (Airy) Gilpin, and grandson of Martin and Katherine (Newby) Gilpin, and great-grandson of William and Elizabeth (Washington) Gilpin. Referring to the MS. of the &quot;Memoirs of the Gilpin Family of Philadelphia,&quot; Vol. 2, page 7, in the Gilpin room of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, we have the following statement which forms the basis for the error:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But the date, residence and tradition combine in fixing Thomas Gilpin, the son of Bernard Gilpin, as the Thomas Gilpin of Mill Hill.&quot; No other proof is offered.<br /><br />The writer first became doubtful about this descent in attempting to check up the marriage and birth records chronologically, and it became clear that Thomas Gilpin of Mill Hill, b. circa 1586 and married 1608, could not have been the son of Bernard Gilpin, bapt. March 1, 1583/4, and whose parents were married in 1580.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Having proved by these records that Thomas Gilpin of Mill Hill was not the son of Bernard and Dorothy (Airy) Gilpin, it remains to establish his parentage. Referring to the Gilpin Chart, we find that Randal Gilpin who married Elizabeth Sykes, had four sons: Richard, Bernard, George and John.&nbsp; Richard Gilpin married and had one son, who died without issue. Bernard Gilpin married and had but one daughter. George Gilpin married and had two sons: Thomas and Barnard. John Gilpin, d. 1591. M. circa 1571, Thomazen Everard, daughter of John Everard of Gillingham, Norfolk, Gentleman, by his wife Dorothy Chancye and sister of Sir Edward Everard, of Gillingham. The will of John Gilpin, of Gillingham, Norfolk and of St Andrew Holborn, Gentleman, dated March 1, 1586, pr. May 10, 1591 mentions wife Thomazen and my six small children and hers (names not given). The Gilpin Chart, however, mentions their names as Everard, John, Christian, Grace, Ursula and Theophilia.<br /><br />Referring to the children of Thomas Gilpin of Mill Hill, parish of Caton, it will be observed that he named sons: George, Francis, Everard, John and Darias. If he was the son of George, it is quite probable that he would name his eldest son George, which was the case. On the other hand, if he was the son of John and Thomazen (Everard) Gilpin, he might name sons John and Everard, which was the case.<br /><br />It is quite probable that Thomas of Mill Hill was a posthumous child of John and Thomazen (Everard) Gilpin, as John, in his will 1586, states that his six children were young. Perhaps Thomas was brought up by his uncle George from childhood, whidh might account for his naming his eldest son George. It is significant that he had sons John and Everhard.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />My own note:&nbsp; Because of this record of information, I have identified in my tree that this Thomas Gilpin of Mill Hill is the son of John and Thomazen Gilpin.<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>
