Reckitt (1988), John S. Peart-Binns<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/31590">http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/31590</a><br />Reckitt, Maurice Benington (1888–1980), writer and Christian sociologist, was born in Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire, on 19 June 1888, the eldest of the three children and elder son of Arthur Benington Reckitt and his wife, Helen Annie Thomas. His parents' influence on his character was both creditable and corrosive. Arthur Reckitt, a director of Reckitt's of Hull (producer of Reckitt's Blue) ensured that there was always an income (and later a fortune) without his son having to work for it. But his suicide in 1927 bequeathed to Maurice Reckitt a deep emotional fear of himself. His mother, nurtured in the Catholic tradition of the Church of England, gave her son the foundation of a firm faith. The too-distant father was more than complemented by an over-protective and possessive mother. Her doting fondness fostered her son's vanity which later sometimes led to a morbid egotism.<br /><br />Delicate health in boyhood deprived Reckitt of formal education and prevented him serving in the First World War, but a procession of private tutors enabled him to reach St John's College, Oxford, in 1907. He gained a second class in modern history in 1911. Ernest Barker kindled in him an abiding interest in the nature and significance of medieval order. Other educators at this and later stages of his life were H. A. L. Fisher, G. K. Chesterton, A. R. Orage, J. N. Figgis, P. E. T. Widdrington, and V. A. Demant.<br /><br />For two years only Reckitt earned his living as a schoolmaster at Ipswich grammar school. &#8216;A meteor flashed across our sky&#8217;, was the headmaster's comment. Returning to Oxford in 1913 Reckitt intended writing a thesis but he was diverted by other claims and interests. An unlikely friendship developed between Reckitt and G. D. H. Cole. Although an unapproachable cold atheist, and at root an anarchist, Cole joined forces with Reckitt, the clubbable, romantic medievalist, archetypal bourgeois, and unswerving Anglican with a dogmatic faith, to found the National Guilds League in 1915. Its aim was to promote the abolition of the wage system and the establishment of self-government in industry through a structure of national guilds working in conjunction with the state. Reckitt's interest in the restoration of medieval guilds waned when the guild movement began to split in 1920. He became a prominent member of the Church Socialist League and editor of its journal, Church Socialist (1915–19) and in 1923 chairman of the new League of the Kingdom of God. This developed as a reaction against the politicization of the church's social teaching and the adulation of communism by some of his friends. If Reckitt hated anything it was Soviet communism, which he saw as atheist, autocratic, ruthless, and materialist. This caused many strains in his relationships, not least with his sister, Eva Collet Reckitt (the founder of Collet's Bookshop—known as the &#8216;Bomb Shop&#8217;). If Reckitt's conviction was always socialist his commitment was to &#8216;earth and altar&#8217;, to church social action rather than political action.<br /><br />Reckitt's vocation was to be available. He spent a lifetime co-ordinating and leavening the thinking of small groups together with such people as T. S. Eliot, Dorothy L. Sayers, T. M. Heron, Philip Mairet, and many priests. He spoke at most of the major church conferences of his time, and was a good organizer. Though voluble and loquacious he always expressed an independent judgement: the dullest committee was enlivened and shaken by the friendly lash of his tongue. He was a member of the church assembly, the British Council of Churches, and many other bodies. He chaired committees, some of which produced significant reports such as Gambling: an Ethical Discussion (1950).<br /><br />Above all Reckitt was a writer and Christian sociologist. His literary output was prodigious. Books, pamphlets, essays, articles, and reviews flowed from his pen. He was a contributor and reviewer for Orage's New Age, a member of the editorial board of G. K.'s Weekly, and an editorial writer for the New English Weekly. Among his books, Faith and Society (1932) was a seminal work and his Scott Holland memorial lectures of 1946, Maurice to Temple (1947), describing a century of the social movement in the Church of England, are of permanent value. He most enjoyed collaborating with others in producing books, the most notable being Prospect for Christendom (1945), which he edited.<br /><br />Perhaps Reckitt's abiding legacy is Christendom, a quarterly journal of Christian sociology which he edited from 1931 to 1950. Together with the annual summer school of sociology at Oxford it shone like a beacon for those churchmen who felt despondent, disillusioned, and discontented. Spirited thinkers and debaters wrote in Christendom and spoke at the summer schools. The Christendom group stood for autochthonous thought and activity and was once denounced as &#8216;the rudest group in the Church of England&#8217; (private information). Reckitt himself eschewed social scientists and scientific economics and bypassed sociological evidence. Reckitt was one of the best-known names in the church, which he maintained had three functions: to worship God, to bind up the wounds of the world, and to prophesy. He endeavoured to live according to the spirit of a phrase of G. K. Chesterton's which he often quoted: &#8216;One must somehow learn to love the world without trusting it.&#8217; (private information).<br /><br />Reckitt had some irritating quirks of character. He was fastidious about what he ate and when he ate it. His handwriting was notoriously illegible. Towards the end of his life he was much given to introspection and anxiety about whether he would get through the needle's eye. On 25 November 1920 he married Evelyn Aimée (1890/91–1968), daughter of Arthur Douglas Peppercorn, artist. She was a professional violinist (Aimée Carvel). She shared many of her husband's recreational pursuits but not his faith. They had no children.<br /><br />Reckitt's recreations were pursued with verve and vigour. He was a ballroom dancer of distinction, a writer of revues and ballades, and a patron of the theatre. Chiefly he played &#8216;the noble game&#8217; of croquet and was president of the Croquet Association from 1967 until 1975. He played in every Brighton August tournament for sixty years and represented Surrey on forty occasions. The Christendom Trust was established in 1968 and an M. B. Reckitt research fellowship was established at the University of Sussex. Reckitt died on 11 January 1980 at Roehampton, London.<br /><br />JOHN S. PEART-BINNS, rev.<br /><b>Sources &nbsp;<br /></b>M.
