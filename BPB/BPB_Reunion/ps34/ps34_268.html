<div class="psNotesData"><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1313849/Desmond-Harney.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1313849/Desmond-Harney.html</a><br /><br /><br /><font color="#171717">Desmond Harney<br /></font><font color="#1e1e1e"><br /><br /></font><font color="#303030">12:00AM GMT 09 Jan 2001<br /></font><font color="#1e1e1e"><br />Diplomat who fell in love with Iran and wrote an eye-witness account of the revolution that brought down the Shah<br />DESMOND HARNEY, who has died aged 71, fell in love with Iran during 16 years in the Diplomatic Service; on abandoning intelligence work he took up local politics and became Mayor of Kensington and Chelsea.<br />After joining the Diplomatic Service in 1954 Harney studied Persian with Professor Nancy Lambton at the School of Oriental and African Studies. In 1958 he was posted to the Embassy in Iran. At that time the Shah, who in 1953 had been restored to his throne with foreign assistance, was determined to gather all the reins of power into his own hands, though forced to proceed cautiously. In that relatively liberal climate, Harney was able to meet a wide spectrum of younger Iranian politicians and to acquire valuable experience.<br />In 1964 he was posted to the High Commission in Nairobi, where in the delicate period following independence he was able to build up relationships with both black and white politicians around President Kenyatta. He was appointed OBE. He returned to a posting in Iran in 1971, when the Shah was near the apogee of his power. He was able to observe the Shah more closely than most. At a time when few embassy staff had historical knowledge of Iranian politics, Harney's judgment was appreciated by successive ambassadors.<br />He admired the Shah's intellectual and administrative abilities, but was well aware of his personal and political failings. No more than any other Western analyst did he foresee the timing of the coming revolution; he used to comment, though, that if the Shah was overthrown, the clergy, the only traditional class that had not been crushed by the Shah, would play the leading role.<br />Harney loved to travel in Iran and photograph its landscape and people. He undertook a mule trek in the remote Valley of the Assassins, and made a long journey through the mountains with the Bakhtiari tribespeople during their annual migration. There were few mountains he left unclimbed in the countries where he lived. Harney had a deep affection for Iran and for Iranians. Rather than leave the country at the end of his posting, he accepted in 1974 an appointment as Morgan Grenfell's representative there, and remained for five years in the period leading up to the Islamic Revolution in 1979.<br />In 1998 his book, The Priest and the King, an account of the Iranian revolution through the eyes of an informed Persian-speaking foreigner, was published in London and well received. It was rapidly pirated in Teheran. Desmond Edward St Aubyn Harney was born in London on February 14 1929, the only son of the Liberal MP for South Shields, who died shortly after his birth. Desmond was educated by the Jesuits at the Corby School in Sunderland. After National Service with the RAF, during which he spent a year in Pakistan shortly after partition, he took a First in Geography and Geology at Durham.<br />On his return to London from Iran in 1979, he continued working for Morgan Grenfell, but his thoughts turned to politics. Too old for a constituency, he became chairman of Chelsea Conservative Association and a Kensington and Chelsea councillor. Eventually he became mayor of the borough. He played a part in the deselection of Sir Nicholas Scott as candidate for the new parliamentary seat of Kensington and Chelsea in late 1996. Later Harney would join the Pro-European Conservative party.<br />Harney was president of the British Institute of Persian Studies. He married, in 1954, Judith Downing, who survives him, together with their three children.</font></div>
