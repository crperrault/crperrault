<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C2097">2097</a></span> CHRISTOPHER 14 GILPIN. (no dates given). Christopher was the eldest of six children born to William Gilpin's (1578) second wife Magdalen Danby. Christopher inherited Kentmere Hall when his step-brother George (1596,above) died childless in 1646.<br /><br />Christopher Gilpin took the Kings side in the English Civil War, and had to flee the country when he became a marked man. Kentmere Hall and it's lands were confiscated and lost for ever to the Gilpins. <b>It is believed that Christopher Gilpin failed to produce a male heir</b>, though whilst he was living in exile it is hard to say how anyone could confirm this for certain. It is probable that Christopher escaped to Ireland, and there are now many Gilpins living there, could any of those be descendants of Christopher?. The following is taken from &quot;Memoirs of Bernard Gilpin&quot; by the Rev. C, S, Collingwood in 1884 :&quot;But his heir, coming home in a time of quiet, was not able to get hold of the proper deeds to recover the estate and it was totally lost to the family.&quot; The above is intriguing, Christopher's wife gave birth to a daughter, who had married and stayed in England when her parents had to leave the country, but did they produce a son in Ireland?. After the civil war, it was recognised that farming in the Kentmere valley was in a poor state, due mainly to the turmoil at Kentmere hall, how on earth did the Gilpins of Green Quarter and Hallow Bank manage to survive all this?. One, <b>Robert Gilpin, was a Sergeant in the local loyalist army</b>, and was prosecuted for the same. The others would have taken a lot of flack for his actions and those of their cousins at Kentmere Hall, and in my view did well to survive this period.<br /><br />One dau from second wife<br /><br />When civil war broke out in 1642, Christopher was a captain in the local army supporting King James the first, and took an active part against Cromwell's men. In 1649 the King was executed and Cromwell was in control, Christopher Gilpin became a marked man and had to leave the country in a hurry. It is said that Christopher left the deeds for the estate in a kind of a trust mortgage in the hands of a trusted friend, possibly his son-in-law Nathanial Nicholson of Hawkshead Hall, but Kentmere Hall and the estate were confiscated by the Government and Katherine lost her X40 per year. It is said that Christopher died overseas without producing a male heir, though this would be difficult to confirm. Katherine Gilpin (formally Philipson) in the meantime was in dire straits, as reported by C Roy Hudleston, quoting a Dr Fahy who had made a study of Royalist composition papers:- &quot;She and her children for want of maintenance, this being their whole livelihood are ready to perish.&quot; (I cannot find any record of children, and none are mentioned in Katherine's will) The estate was lost forever to the Gilpin family, though &quot;On 22 of July 1652 the committee allowed the jointure deed, and ordered the sequestration which had been made in 1648, to be discharged on Katherine making oath that she had not released her interest in the lands.&quot; In other words, in 1652 Katherine regained her forty pounds per year. The end is complicated, as indicated above Christopher Gilpin's daughter had married a Nathanial Nicholson of Hawkshead Hall. The following is taken from an article by Joe Scot, published Feb. 1999, Kentmere Hall And The Gilpins 1373-1672:- &quot;After the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 it was claimed by Katherine's Philipson relations and by Christopher's son-in-law Nathanial Nicholson of Hawkshead that Christopher had sold the Kentmere estate to one or other of them before he fled. (the trusted friend) In 1669 Katherine Gilpin, George Gilpin's (1540) widow, was living at the Hall and was taxed on one hearth. So was Nathanial Nicholson taxed on two. The unfortunate Katherine died in 1672 ending the 300 year connection of Gilpins with the hall. There were complex legal battles for the next twenty years, but in the end the Philipsons seem to have bought out the Nicholson interest and later they sold the Hall and estate to Daniel Fleming of Rydal. It has been owned by absentee landlords and let out to tenant farmers ever since.&quot; Katherine's will of 1672 is a very bleak document, approximately one hundred and twenty words in all, it speaks volumes about the end at Kentmere Hall, which at this stage was probably a very sad, lonely place. Katherine left all that she had to her maid, Jane Hodgson. There is no mention of her home sharer Nathanial Nicholson or his family, and once again we canonly guess that the atmosphere at the hall must have been very strained. Compare Katherine's will to that of Gawen Gilpin, who lived in the neighbouring valley of Longsleddale, and died 1667. Gawen mentions at least twenty three family and friends, and leaves them all a little something of varying amounts. Katherine does not even mention her God, which for the wills of that period is very unusual, a very sad ending to a brilliant chapter.<br /><br />[Commonwealth Probates, vol 4, 1655, from Matthews vol 8] Charistopher Gilpin, of Stealend, Kentmere, Kendal, son of Wm &#8220;vivens&#8221;,  Will [393 Ayett] pr )ct 10 by relict Ann</div>
