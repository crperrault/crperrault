<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Joseph Gilpin</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C2097">2097</a></span> JOSEPH GILPIN, born in 1664, married Hannah Glover in 1691, and with his wife and two small children, emigrated to America in 1695, and settled in Birmingham Chester (now Delaware) County, Pa.. Joseph being a Quaker, and seeing his fellow members treated with contumely by the government, and being a young man with a small family, he naturally desired to be released from the exactions of others, and determined to try what relief the then wilds of America would afford. He was to be a frontier settler; the forest still waved over the spot that was to be his future home, the trees of large size were to be hewed down to make room for the cereals, that were to furnish his-------------------------(continued on the next page) future bread. To accomplish this, he had to rely upon his own exertions, each settler had his home to prepare, and could not greatly assist his neighbour. One of the first considerations necessary, on arriving at the new home, was to provide shelter for his family, so he constructed a cave by the side of a rock, and in which he continued to reside for a considerable time. There is much to be said in favour of a cave on a dry subsoil for its warmth and healthfulness, and this the first settler found to be the case, for in it 13 of his children were born, and all of them lived to marry and no doubt found it warmer than the rude structure raised entirely above the earth. We are unacquainted with the extent of his landed possessions, one account says, Joseph Gilpin and Co. owned 700 acres. John D. Gilpin, who owns part of the original tract, still retains a small memento of his predecessor in a pair of silver candle-sticks, and has upon his land the original site of the cave.<br /><br />Joseph Gilpin and family had for the companions of their voyage to America, the ancestors of the Coats and Morris families of Philadelphia. He died, 9th of Nov. 1741, at which time he left 15 children, and 45 grandchildren. At the death of their mother in 1757, there were living 12 children and 62 grandchildren, and in 1763, there were 10 children and 64 grandchildren, and 70 great grandchildren.<br /><br />Alan James Gilpin.
