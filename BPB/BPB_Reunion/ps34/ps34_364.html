<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Thomas Gilpin</div>

<div class="psNotesData">[CRP] If he critical dates concerning Thomas and his children are correct, it is unlikely that he was ancestor to Benjamin (&lt;1680)<br /><br />THOMAS GILPIN of Warborough, born in 1620, married Joan Bartholomew and had three sons, Joseph, Isaac, and Thomas. He was an officer of the army, and after the battle of Worcester, 3rd of Sep. 1651, joined the society of friends. In 1661 he was detained seven weeks in the marshal's custody at Oxford for refusing to take the oath of allegiance. On May 29th 1670, a meeting was held at his house for which the Justice find him £20, and on the 26th of June, of the some year, another meeting was held at his house, for which the Justice authorised the officers to break open locks and bolts, and they took away his household goods, not leaving him a bed, or a pot in which to boil his food. Sometime after this he gathered his corn off about three acres of land, which the officers took away with two pigs. In 1672, by the King's letters patent, many persons were discharged from imprisonment, some having been confined for a long time. From Oxford jail 15 persons were liberated, amongst whom was Thomas Gilpin. The Gilpin family frequently had to suffer on account of their religion. The race that once went bravely forth To beard the wild boar in his den, Now meets the bigots in their wrath, And boldly claims the rights of men. &quot;<br /><br />Alan James Gilpin. Kentmere Hall and Beyond: The Gilpin Family and their History (Kindle Locations 465-473). Kindle Edition. <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C2100">2100</a></span> Quaker Minister<br />Thomas Gilpin, who was baptized 24 August 16 22 at Caton Parish Church, Westmorel and/ Lancashire. Left Kendall as a young man and traveled to London , where he apprenticed to the trade of a tallow chandler. His lifestyle at this time, according to a Quaker publication called Piety Promoted, Thomas spent his time in the pursuit of . foolish delights as sports and pastimes, musik and dancing . . .He served as a soldier in the Parliamentary War's (family tradition states he was a colonel, and fought at the Battle of Worcester in 1651). After the Wars he removed to Oxfordshire and was married prior to 1651 to Joan Bartholomew, daughter of Thomas Bartholomew (alias Martin), a farmer of Shillingsford in the parish of Warborough, Oxfordshire.18 Joan was baptized at the church in Warborough on 28 August 1625. For a little while the Gilpin's lived with Joan's father, but in time they settled at the village of Warborough permanently. Around 1654 during a visit to London, Gilpin met and was converted to the doctrines of the Society of Friends (Quakers). When he returned to his home, Gilpin set up his home for the gathering of Friends for worship service. In 1662 he became a Quaker minister and preached the doctrines of his faith to the surrounding countryside, London and even to Wales. The Quakers were severely persecuted and often hunted down and cast into prison. Gilpin experienced all of this having served time in prison at Oxford Castle and at Newgate Prison in London. He was fined £ 20 for holding a meeting in his home in May 1670. A month later it is reported: &quot;`Was another Meeting at the said Thomas Gilpin's,' when the officers of the law, `broke open his Door, and took away his Household Goods, leaving him not a Bed to lie on, nor a Pot to boil his Food in. He had a Family of five small Children which suffered much through this Seizure. Some Time after, as soon as he had got his Corn in, being about three Acres, the Officers came and took that also, with two Pigs, in all the value of £11.&quot;</div>
