He first studied physic, but afterwards took a degree of Doctor of Divinity, and was presented to the rectory of Greystock (Greystoke) in Cumberland. Not liking the conduct of the church, he embraced Presbyterianism, but was no approver of Cromwell. After the restoration, the King being desirous to pursue a more moderate policy, Dr Gilpin was fixed upon for the Bishopric of Carlisle, but he declined it. 4 After resigning Greystoke, he purchased Scaleby Castle in Cumberland, where he lived for some time. This was a fortress of considerable consequence situated on the confines of England and Scotland, and erected by the English lords to repel the invasion of the Scots, and stands within a short distance of the wall built by the Emperor Hadrian to prevent the inroads of the Picts. It extended from Solway Firth to New Castle on Tyne, a considerable part is still standing, now called the Picts wall. The Castle was besieged by Cromwell, and afterwards purchased by Dr Gilpin; it is now a mixture of ancient ruins and modern comforts, the moat, which circumscribed the walls, contained five acres, but the buildings are greatly in ruins. Numerous Roman utensils have been dug up here. He lived here, dispensing both a minister and a physician, bestowing comforts to all around him, until invited by the dissenters of New Castle on Tyne, which he embraced and was their pastor. He died here 15th, Feb. 1699, aged 74 y.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C2099">2099</a></span> Author, w John Miller of &#8220;Treatise on Satan&#8217;s Temptations&#8221;<br /><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zFuNbH6SB9kC&amp;lpg=PR56&amp;ots=Gkg4PF-XnJ&amp;dq=Gilpin%20Strickland%20Roger&amp;pg=PR16#v=onepage&amp;q=Gilpin%20Strickland%20Roger&amp;f=false">http://books.google.com/books?id=zFuNbH6SB9kC&amp;...%20Roger&amp;f=false</a><br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C2099">2099</a></span> [p xxix] for description of how Quakers attempted to take over Gilpin&#8217;s parish.
