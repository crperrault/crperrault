<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Hon. Andrew Stuart</div>

<div class="psNotesData">[LBP] Admis au Barreau en 1807.  Devint membre du Parlement Provincial pour la Basse Ville de Québec en 1815 et pour la Haute Ville jusqu'à ce qu'il devienne Soliciteur-General pour le Bas- Canada, poste qu'il occupa jusqu'à sa mort (1837-40).  Lui et ses frères, sauf l'aîné, furent instruits par Mgr Strachan, qui plus tard l'amena ainsi que James Cartwright à Québec à l'époque où ils commencèrent les études du droit.  En 1810 il fit la défense de l'Hon Juge Bedard.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C912">912</a></span>[Audette] Hon Andrew Stuart had 6 children, two (Sir Andrew and Henry) from Marguerite Dumoulin, and the other four from Jane Smith.  He was not married to either woman.  His will is dated 24.2.1838 and was probated in Quebec 25.2.1840.  In it, he bequests his movable estate to &#8220;my sons Andrew and Henry&#8221; and the usufruct of his real estate to them with the property thereof to &#8220;their children&#8221;, charges them with a life annuity of 50 pounds to &#8220;their mother&#8221;, and bequeaths 250 pounds to H. Black &#8220;to be applied in the manner by me explained to him, but for the application whereof he shall not be accountable to any person whatever&#8221;, and names as his executors his sons Andrew and Henry.  Audette also dismisses (for reasons of biological implausibility and lack of supporting documents) the claim made by P. G. Roy in his &#8220;Famille Bailly de Messein&#8221; and &#8220;Famille P. A. de Gaspé&#8221; that the mother Sir Andrew was Charlotte Duchouquet Dumoulin, rather than her daughter Marguerite.  There apparently exists a letter from PG Roy to LBP explaining how he intentionally made this &#8220;entorse a la vérité&#8221; to protect the honour of the families.<br /><br /><br /><br />[DBC] <b>STUART</b>, <b>ANDREW</b>, lawyer, politician, office holder, and author; b. 25&nbsp;Nov.&nbsp;1785 in Cataraqui (Kingston, Ont.), fifth son of John <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-110.01-e.php?list=3682+5856+2677&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Stuart*</a></font></u></b>, a Church of England clergyman, and Jane Okill; m. first Marguerite Dumoulin, and they had two sons, one of them Andrew*; m. secondly Jane Smith, and they had three daughters and a son; d.&nbsp;21&nbsp;Feb.&nbsp;1840 at Quebec.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stuarts, a large family, lived at Cataraqui from 1785 and had a place in the local élite through the influence of the Reverend&nbsp;Mr Stuart, rather than through their wealth. Andrew Stuart was privileged to have John <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=4729&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Strachan*</a></font></u></b> as a tutor for several years, and then went to Union College in Schenectady, N.Y.&nbsp;He studied law in Lower Canada and was called to the bar on 5&nbsp;Nov.&nbsp;1807. Like his brother James*, he went into practice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a few years Stuart carved out an enviable place in the legal field, and despite stiff competition became one of the most sought-after and best-paid lawyers in the Quebec region. He was, in fact, involved in all the major cases. Early in his career, for example, he conducted a spirited defence of Pierre-Stanislas<a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=2781&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Bédard*</a></font></u></b>, who had been imprisoned in March&nbsp;1810 on the orders of Governor Sir&nbsp;James Henry <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=2346&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Craig*</a></font></u></b>. He did not, however, succeed in obtaining a writ of habeas corpus for him from the Court of King&#8217;s Bench. Like François <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=2758&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Blanchet*</a></font></u></b> and Jean-Thomas <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-110.01-e.php?list=3155+6456&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Taschereau*</a></font></u></b>, who were arrested at the same time, Bédard was involved in publishing Le Canadien. Stuart was chosen as counsel for the defence because he was on close terms with Bédard, who considered the Stuart brothers &#8220;friends of the Canadians.&#8221; In addition, Stuart served as the lawyer for the Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice in Montreal, which had to defend the title to its assets against the crown&#8217;s claims [see Jean-Henry-Auguste <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=3109&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Roux*</a></font></u></b>]. His clients also included Quebec financiers and wealthy merchants, in particular those who had founded the Quebec Bank in 1818 [see John William <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=4257&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Woolsey*</a></font></u></b>]. Stuart was legal adviser for the bank directors and on several occasions was able to get them out of difficulty. They certainly were not inexperienced in business, but they had every reason to congratulate themselves for having made an ally of such a renowned jurist.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young lawyers found it interesting to be associated with Stuart. This was the experience of Henry<a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-110.01-e.php?list=4839+2874&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Black*</a></font></u></b>. Called to the bar in 1820, he practised in partnership with Stuart for a good many years. A number of young men who subsequently distinguished themselves articled with them.&nbsp;Joseph <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=3260&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">B</u>ouchette</a></font></b>, a friend of Stuart&#8217;s, entrusted his son <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-110.01-e.php?list=3566+4847&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Robert-Shore-Milnes*</a></font></u></b> to him early in the 1820s, and William Locker Pickmore<a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=4980&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Felton*</a></font></u></b>, later a Liberal-Conservative assemblyman, also articled in the office of Stuart and Black. It was to them that the Irish community of the town turned in 1831 when seeking to buy land on which to build a Catholic church for the English-speaking population [see John <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-110.01-e.php?list=2790+8060&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Cannon*</a></font></u></b>].<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his Souvenirs d&#8217;un demi-siècle Joseph-Guillaume <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=5952&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Barthe*</a></font></u></b> tells of the trial of an Indian accused by the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company of murder and armed robbery. Andrew Stuart, with several colleagues, acted for the defence, James Stuart for the crown. The week-long trial gave the brothers a chance to exchange many arguments. The skirmishes between the two were not meant to amuse the spectators, but to some extent they were indeed part of a game. In another case, between Toussaint <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=3610&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">P</u>othier </a></font></b>and Marie-Amable<a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=3917&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Foretier*</a></font></u></b>, Andrew had the opportunity to replace his brother; James apparently had had enough of confronting Joseph-Rémi Vallières de Saint-Réal, who was given to flamboyant courtroom speeches.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuart also expended considerable energy in the counterpart to his legal career, politics. He became involved at a time when the colony&#8217;s political life was in process of transformation. He was first elected to the House of Assembly for Lower Town Quebec as a candidate of the Canadian party. He represented this riding from 13&nbsp;May&nbsp;1814 till 9&nbsp;Feb.&nbsp;1820, and then that of Upper Town from 25&nbsp;July&nbsp;1820 till 2&nbsp;Sept.&nbsp;1830. In its early years the Canadian party had a few English-speaking members, in particular John <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=3578&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">N</u>eilson </a></font></b>and Andrew and James Stuart, for whom the rights of the assembly were of greater significance than the prerogatives of the crown. The two Stuarts came to have real influence on the party, whose leading members in the period before 1815 lived at Quebec. The colonial link and British institutions were not yet being challenged (as they would be around 1830), and it was the famous question of supply that became the Stuarts&#8217; favourite issue.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrew Stuart ran in Upper Town in the 1834 elections but was beaten. He had left the Canadian party a short time before to join the government camp. This change of direction can be attributed to his own intellectual consistency rather than to any struggle for influence within the Canadian party, which in 1826 had become the Patriote party. Louis-Joseph <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=5203&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Papineau*</a></font></u></b>, its leader, had hardened his stance and, although there were not many of them, the assemblymen who, like Stuart, were committed only to administrative reform chose to leave the party.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subsequently Stuart proved a fierce adversary of Papineau. He sat once more for Upper Town Quebec from 26&nbsp;March&nbsp;1836 till 27&nbsp;March&nbsp;1838, replacing René-Édouard <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=4878&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Caron*</a></font></u></b>, who had resigned the seat. He came to support the planned union of Upper and Lower Canada, and as president of the Constitutional Association, which had in its ranks William <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=4320&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Bristow*</a></font></u></b>, Thomas Cushing <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=4804&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Aylwin*</a></font></u></b>, George Pemberton, and John Neilson, he went to England in 1838 to promote the scheme. On 25&nbsp;October of that year he was appointed solicitor general of Lower Canada, an office he held until his death.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuart&#8217;s talents as a jurist, combined with his political involvement, no doubt helped to open doors for him.&nbsp;He also acquired an undeniable distinction through frequenting the literary circles and learned societies of his time. With his brother James he belonged to the coterie of Louise-Amélie Panet, who held a salon in her manor-house at Sainte-Mélanie which they attended along with Jacques <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=4235&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Viger*</a></font></u></b>, Denis-Benjamin <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=4760&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Viger*</a></font></u></b>, and Louis-Joseph Papineau Stuart&#8217;s interest in literature, history, and science led him to write several articles and works that show a detailed knowledge of the topics. Elected president of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec in 1832, he gave a number of lectures before its members on subjects as varied as classical poetry and Roman history. In addition he produced several interesting essays that were published by the society.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 23&nbsp;Feb.&nbsp;1828 Andrew and David Stuart had been appointed commissioners for exploring the tract of country known as the king&#8217;s posts. Accompanied by geologist Frederick Henry <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=4807&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Baddeley*</a></font></u></b>, who was also a member of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec, they visited that region, located north of the river and gulf of St Lawrence, and made a study of it. Their report, which Andrew wrote, was published by the society in 1831 under the title Report of the commissioners for exploring the country lying between the rivers Saguenay, Saint Maurice and Saint Lawrence. He contributed in a more tangible fashion to the development of the organization by helping it to obtain an initial government grant for the publication of its transactions. On several occasions he made personal donations to its library and museum.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuart also belonged to the Société pour l&#8217;Encouragement des Sciences et des Arts en Canada, of which he became vice-president. This association, which was founded at Quebec in 1827, pursued aims similar to those of the Literary and Historical Society. The most active members of one were often indeed leaders in the other. Sir&nbsp;James <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=4004&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">Kempt*</a></font></u></b> finally intervened to encourage their amalgamation in 1829. Needless to say, these learned societies brought together the town&#8217;s intellectual élite. At their meetings Andrew met his colleague Henry Black and his friends Joseph Bouchette and John Charlton <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=3382&PHPSESSID=c1n08daeu6l8j70b2m8t2sl486"><b><u><font color="#522603">F</u>isher</a></font></b>.&nbsp;Stuart also contributed regularly to the Star and Commercial Advertiser/ L&#8217;Étoile et Journal de Commerce, which was published at Quebec from 1827 till 1830.
