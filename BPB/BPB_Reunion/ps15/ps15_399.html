<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Andrew Stuart II</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1473">1473</a></span> An Andrew Stewart took the Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity on 28 Jan 1778 as directed by an act of General Assembly of Pennsylvania passed 13 June 1777<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1474">1474</a></span> Born 28 Apr 1742 [CRP -- not 1748] as is noted in the will book in Pittsburgh, in Paxtang.  He never married (Trad.).  He was executor, with his br James, of his father&#8217;s will, 1772.  He was captain of the 19th battallion of Lancaster county troops and took a prominent part in public affairs during the Revolutionary war and afterwards.  He was one of the leaders in the movement to establish the new county of Dauphin out of the northern portion of Lancaster, and was chosen as one of the commissioners.  In 1792 he sold his plantation in Paxtang and went to Ross twp, Allegheny Co.  He had large land holdings and rode from place to place as his business required.  He was undoubtedly the Andrew Stewart who witnessed the will of Hugh Stewart of Paxtang 14 Apr 1796.  His will, dated 14 Jun 1827 was prob 28 Apr 1830, probably soon after his death.  The clerk of probate, we can imagine, heard someone remark that if Capt. Stewart had lived to that day he would have been 88 yrs old for the clerk dipped his quill in the ink and made a notation on the folio:  &#8220;Born April 28th, 1742&#8221;.  The captain&#8217;s will requested that if he die in Allegheny co he be buried in the &#8220;same graveyard that my sister Mary Rankin is buried in&#8221;.  To George, John and James Stewart, sons of his brother John, he bequeathed $100 each.  &#8220;To the natural born children of Charles Stewart, $100 to be divided equally among them&#8221;.  To Andrew Stewart [CRP -- could be Hon Andrew, 1785-1840, but why is he not included with his brothers?], $100.  To the children of Mary Stewart Jones [CRP -- dau of Rev John, d. 1812] , $100 equally divided.  To the children of Nancy Stewart Smith [CRP-  could be Ann Stuart, dau of Rev John, m. Patrick Smyth], $100, etc.  Bequests were made to &#8220;my sister Eleanor Dermond&#8217;s family,&#8221; each by name, and to &#8220;Mary Means that now lives with me.&#8221;  The will further provides for the disposal of his lands in Alleghany, Westmoreland, Franklin, and Dauphin counties.</div>
