Le lien de parente serait le Duc de Monmouth, dont le certificat de mariage de sa mere au roi Charles II aurait ete detruit par le Duc de Buccleugh et Monmouth.  <br /><br />Andrew perhaps has another brother, John.  He was a Covenanter of the most rigid faith, and of the earliest of the Reformed Presbyterians in America.  <br /><br />[Dimwiddie papers] A.

CP IX:60ff shows James, said to be illegitimate son of Charles II, by Lucy Walters, was born 9 Apr 1649 in Rotterdam [but see fn (b), about the claim that he was really the son of Robert Sydney]  He was educated in Paris, and, in the autumn of 1662, in anticipation of his marriage, changed his name to James Scott, and as such was knighted.  He was cr in 1662/3 Baron Scott of Tindale, Earl of Doncaster, and Duke of Monmouth.  MA (Cantab) 1662/3,  K.G. 1663.  He married, 20 Apr  1663, in London, Anne, s.j. Countess of Buccleuch [S], on the occasion of which he was cr Duke of Buccleuch, Earl of Dalkeith, and Lord Scott of Whitchester and Eskdale [S].  Chancellor of Cambridge, 1674.  The great storm of 1674/5 devastated his estates in Scotland and he was licensed in 1675 to import horses and cattle from Ireland.  Capt-Gen of all land forces in England, Wales and Berwick 1678, and Scotland 1679.  In command of the British forces in Flanders 1678.  Following the revelations of the Popish Plot 1678, the anti-papists pressed for his recognition as the legitimate heir of the throne, but the King issued a proclamation that the only wife he had married was Queen Catherine.  He was sent to Scotland to put down the rising of the Covenanters, which he did decisively at Bothwell Bridge 22 Jun 1679.  Charles, concerned about his growing popularity, dismissed him from his Scottish command in Sep 1679 and ordered him to leave the country.  He crossed to Holland, but returned by Nov and was then deprived of most of his lucrative posts.  In 1680, great efforts were made by the anti-Papists to persuade the public that the King had married the Duke&#8217;s mother, and on 2 Jun Charles reissued a declaration denying the story.  HE continued to intrigue against the King, refusing to leave the country, until he was arrested in Sep 1682(?), brought to London, but soon released on bail.  His participation in the plans for a general insurrection brought him in close relations with those who were plotting the assassination of the King and the Duke of York, and there can be no doubt that he was privy to their designs, though possibly with no guilty intention.  When the Rye House plot was discovered in Jun 1683, he went into hiding and was found guilty of high treason in Jul.  He bought his pardon in Nov by offering to inform against his associates.  He left for the Netherlands where he was when Charles II died in 1685.  He now entered into relations with Scottish exiles and planned the simultaneous invasion of Scotland and England with the Earl of Argyll.  He landed at Lyme Regis on 11 Jun 1685 and on the 20th was proclaimed King at Taunton.  He was defeated by the royal forces on 5 Jul, and fled disguised as a peasant, being found hidden on the 8th.  He was conveyed to London and beheaded on 15 Jul 1685.  His English honours became forfeited, but his Scottish ones, enjoyed s.j. by his widow, survived.  <br /><br />The Duke of Monmouth had two sons.  The eldest, Charles Scott, was born 24 Aug 1672  died 9 Feb 1673/4, and was bur in Westm Abbey.  His brother, James Scott, styled Earl of Doncaster (till his father&#8217;s forfeiture 1685), then Earl of Dalkeith) was born 23 May 1674 and died 14 Mar 1704/5.  He served in Flanders and was knighted 1704.  He married Henrietta, 2nd da of Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester.  He d.v.m. in London.  <br /><br />The Earl of Dalkeith had one son, Francis Scott,  b. 11 Jan 1694/5 at St. James, Westm.  In 1742/3, he was restored as Baron Scot of Tindal and Earl of Doncaster, but not as Duke of Monmouth.

A tradition is that his ancestor, a Stewart of the earls of Galloway, went from Ayrshire to Ireland and settled at Drumcairn, in Killymard parish, county Donegal, midway between Donegal and Killybeg, on land held by James Murray of Broughton, whose wife and mother were Stewarts;  members of this family of Stewarts came to PA and named their settlement Mount Charles, after a place of that name near Drumcairn in Ireland, and about 1800 Robert and Charles of the same Stewart family but a later generation left Drumcairn and settled with their kinfolks in western PA -- E.W.E. in Boston Evening transcript, Mar 26, 1913. <br /><br />about Mountcharles<br /><a href="http://www.dun-na-ngall.com/mountc.html">http://www.dun-na-ngall.com/mountc.html</a><br />Mountcharles is situated 5km west of Donegal Town on an elevated site high above sea level which offers spectacular views of Donegal Bay.<br />The village is named after its founder, Charles Conyngham, who built the village towards the end of the 17th century. In the 18th century the local people worked in the salt works which was also founded by the Conyngham family.

The southern limit of the parish is from Donegal town west along<br />the Bay to nearly Mountcharles. Then the western edge of the parish extends<br />irregularly northward to the confluence of the Owenea and Owengarve Rivers, a<br />few miles east of Glenties. The parish boundary then extends eastward about<br />4 miles along the Owengarve and Reelan Rivers to the point where the<br />Effernagh River joins the Reelan. Then, except for a bump to the east - up<br />in the Blue Stack mountains - the eastern boundary of the parish connects<br />with the Corraber River and follows it down to Lough Eske. The boundary<br />continues through the center of the Lough and continues down the River Eske<br />to Donegal town. I'd say that the entire northern half of the parish is all<br />Blue Stack Mountains, and very lightly settled. I'm sure that's more than<br />you ever cared to know about Killymard. But perhaps someone else might be<br />interested &lt;gr&gt; (doubt it, though).<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1485">1485</a></span> [p 268]   STUART.
