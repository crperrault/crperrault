Her papers are at the McCord Museum Archives.  She would have claimed that the marriage record of Hon. Andrew Stuart and Jane Smith was torn out of the register.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1498">1498</a></span> [Extract of undated letter from Lavinia Stuart to Mary ??]  My grandfather, the Honourable Andrew Stuart, Solicitor-General for Lower Canada, had three wives<br /><br />First - the wife of a French Army officer, by whom he has two sons [CRP. OK, except for the marriage]<br /><br />Secondly - a French lady below Three Rivers, by whom he had two daughters, your grandmother [CRP Mary, Ann or Jane Victoria] and your aunt Mary [CRP. didn&#8217;t Mary die young?]  [CRP.  Clearly false, unless she and Jane Smith were the same person, as birth records for Mary, Jane Victoria, Ann, and Wm Wallace all clearly show same parents]<br /><br />Thirdly -- he married Jane Smith, a finishing pupil at the Ursuline Convent at Quebec, whose financial and private matters were under his care, by whom he had two sons, my father, and another son who died in infancy. [CRP was this Mary?]  I may say she was *not* his housekeeper.<br /><br />As for this marriage, the baptismal records were in my father&#8217;s lifetime to be seen in St. Andrew&#8217;s Presbyterian Church, Quebec, and the party who could have told us exactly where the record could be found of their marriage, died a few years ago. [CRP.  Are there any missing records at St A&#8217;s?]<br /><br />As for the matter with which you are particularly  interested, I fear this will have to be undertaken by yourselves solely as regards any research you might feel inclined to take. [CRP -- what could this be?]<br /><br />My grandfather died when father was sixteen; and as his two step brothers [CRP -- Andrew and Henry]and two step sisters [CRP-- sisters: Mary or Ann and Jane V] were married, and as my father did not himself marry until he was forty, and we two remaining ones [CRP - Lavinia and Henry Black Stuart] were the youngest of seven children [CRP --Wm Wallace had 5 other ch who died young], made us as you are aware contemporary with yourselves [CRP -- Mary, the addressee of the letter, was a ggch of Hon Andrew], with whom we played as children, with the Carter children and Birdie Hall, in the early part of two of three summers, before we went to spend the rest of our holidays with our maternal grand uncle, Archibald Campbell, Prothonotary, at Thornhill House, Quebec, who regarded us as his grandchildren, in view of the great love he bore to our grandmother, Lady MacMahon. [CRP -- Campbell then brother of Lady MacMahon]<br /><br />------------<br /><br />There is a marirage of James Tait and Mary Lavinia G Stuart at Georgetown Presb Ch, 1898.  Unlikely to be her, as she was living w her parents in 1901</div>
