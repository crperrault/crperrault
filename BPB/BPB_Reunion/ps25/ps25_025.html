<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Gen. Henri Alexandre Panet C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.</div>

<div class="psNotesData">The army member was<br /><br />Gen. H. A. Panet, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., the son of a family with<br /><br />military tradition going back to the Ancien Regime and a graduate of<br /><br />Royal Military College with the class of 1891. General Panet had served<br /><br />Canada with distinction in South Africa and during World War I in<br /><br />Europe, where he was wounded and decorated and mentioned in dispatches<br /><br />on seven occasions. In France he had commanded the Royal<br /><br />Canadian Horse Artillery Brigade and later the Second Canadian Divisional<br /><br />Artillery<br /><br /><a href="http://members.shaw.ca/hughlarmstrong/boer/hon.htm">http://members.shaw.ca/hughlarmstrong/boer/hon.htm</a> {For DSO)<br /><br />[<br />Henri Alexandre Panet was born in Quebec City on the 24th July 1869 to one of Canada&#8217;s most illustrious military families (not only were his ancestors military men, but two of his three brothers served in the armed forces). He graduated from the Royal Military College (RMC) in the summer of 1891 and qualified as Lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Artillery on 2nd May 1894.<br /><br />Eager to be among the regulars volunteering for the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment, Panet left the guns and accepted a lower rank. He would spend two months at Belmont Camp before being assigned to &quot;C&quot; Battery, Royal Canadian Field Artillery then on its way from Canada. The posting meant he missed, much to his regret, participating in the Battle of Paardeburg. Buller&#8217;s relief of Ladysmith along with Cronje&#8217;s surrender at Paardeburg left the thirty year old Captain fearing the war would end before he had an opportunity to prove himself in action. He needn&#8217;t have worried.<br /><br />RCA Kit Shop Regimental HQ History of the RCA RCA Regimental Fund Last Post, awards, etc. Links to Other Sites Contact Us<br /><br /><br />&quot;C&quot; Battery was assigned to the Rhodesian Field Force and set sail from Cape Town to Beira in Portuguese East Africa. After debarkation, they marched through Rhodesia and the Transvaal to join with Colonel Plummer&#8217;s forces for the relief of Mafeking. In the first Canadian artillery action of the South African War, &quot;C&quot; Bty moved forward in support of Mahon&#8217;s column as it drove the Boer&#8217;s from Mafeking. Panet won the Distinguish Service Order and the recognition of his troops, as demonstrated by the battery&#8217;s unofficial poet:<br /><br />The next is Capt Panet, who was also in the scrap;<br />His thorough College training fill in many a yawning gap.<br /><br />After Mafeking, &quot;C&quot; Bty spent the rest of the summer as part of the Rhodesian Field Force, commanded by Baden Powell and headquartered at Rustenburg, where they had played no small part in building the fortified camp known as Fort Canada. Sections of the battery supported small mounted columns making sorties from Fort Canada into the surrounding countryside. On his return to Canada in May 1901, Panet was promoted to Major and appointed Staff Adjutant at RMC. Two more senior staff appointments followed until he returned to the regiment in 1909 to command &quot;B&quot; Battery.<br /><br />His promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel on 1 May 1911 was accompanied by his appointment to command the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Brigade and Commandant of the Royal School of Artillery, Kingston (positions he held until 1916). The even of the First World War found Panet and his Brigade in Camp Petawawa for training. After a quick return to Kingston, they found themselves on the way to Valcartier to assist in the training of the Canadian Expeditionary Force only nine days later. On the 26th August, 1914 the Brigade itself mobilized and by the 1st October was en route for Great Britain, where they would spend a cold, wet and miserable winter on Salisbury Plain.<br /><br /> <br />Panet deployed to Flanders with his Brigade on the 25th July 1915. After many frustrating months spent in reserve, the Brigade went into the Somme in late November. Panet would be recognized by a promotion to Colonel and Mentioned-in-Despatches (the first of seven) and his Brigade received British gratitude for the support they gave in the capture of Guillemont and Ginchy. The Somme cost the Canadians over 24,000 casualties and the artillerymen would not be untouched by the experience. In December 1916, Panet was promoted Brigadier-General and appointed Commander, Royal Artillery 2nd Canadian Division (CRA, 2 Div). In this post he would continue to play a vital leadership role for the artillery until April 1919. After the end of hostilities until his retirement in December 1930, General Panet served in a variety of key staff appointments. Even after retirement, Major-General Panet continued to serve the guns. On the 1st November 1934 he accepted the appointment of Colonel Commandant, Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. He served in this role until January 1948.On the 14th August 1951, Henri Alexandre Panet died in Kingston and was buried with full military honours.</div>
