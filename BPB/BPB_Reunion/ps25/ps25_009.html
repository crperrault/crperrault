<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Malcolm Fraser</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Find children and partners<br /><br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C108">108</a></span> In his 1992 article&nbsp; Finding Mary Allaire The French (and German) Ancestry of John B. McLoughlin &nbsp; [published in English and French by the Quebec Family History Society], George T. Brown notes that John B. McLoughlin (or Jean-Baptiste), later known as the Father of Oregon, was the son of John McLoughlin and Angélique Fraser.&nbsp;&nbsp; Angélique was the daughter of the common-law liaison between Malcolm Fraser, a lieutenant in the Fraser Highlanders during the Conquest and later Laird of Mount Murray (Malbaie) and Mary (Marie) Allaire.&nbsp;&nbsp; Malcolm was a staunch Presbyterian and comrade-in-arms to John Nairne.&nbsp;&nbsp; George Brown notes that Mr Lizotte attributes six children to the Allaire-Fraser liaison including Juliana or Julienne; he further contends that all the children of Malcolm Fraser&#8217;s liaisons, except possibly Juliana, were baptized in the Catholic faith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, when Malcolm had custody of the children at Mount Murray he raised them in the Protestant faith. <br /><br />By Marie-Louise Allaire, known as Marie, (1739-1822), Malcolm Fraser had Angélique (1761-1842); Alexander (1763-1837); Joseph (1765-1844); Simon (1768-1844); Marguerite (Apr-Jul 1770); and Juliana (1772-1847).&nbsp;&nbsp; [Marie-Louise Allaire had a younger sister, born in 1749, also named Marie-Louise, who was known as Louise.] <br /><br />By Marie-Josephte Ducros (1763-1837), referred to as Marguerite in Mr Lizotte&#8217;s book on Rivière-du-Loup, Malcolm Fraser had Anne (1792-1877); William (1794-1830); Marguerite (1797-bef.1812); and John Malcolm (1800-1836). &nbsp;There is a hand-written certificate by Rev. Lecourtois, giving the names and dates of birth of Malcolm Fraser&#8217;s children by Marie Ducros, dated at Les Escoumains on 7 April 1855. &nbsp;[Marie-Josephte Ducros was the same age as her step-son Alexander Fraser, whom she predeceased by two months.] <br /><br />Just when we felt that nothing more could possibly be discovered about Malcolm Fraser (1733-1815), progenitor of this fascinating family in Canada, a new door has opened. <br /><br />The latest chapter began with Paul Lessard and Jean-Claude Massé collaborating on their research about Malcolm Fraser and his daughters, Angélique and Juliana. <br /><br />Paul had located a document dated 16 July 1762 [Notary Antoine-Jean Saillant] covering the sale of land to Angélique Fraser, then a baby in her first year of life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her grandmother, Marie-Joseph Molleur, acted for the child, whose mother, Marie Allaire, was also part of the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was supplemented by another notary contract dated 8 Nov 1771 [Notary Jean-Claude Panet], discovered by his colleague, whereby Malcolm Fraser gave lands situated at Beaumont to Miss Marie Allaire, asking her to take care of their children, namely, Alexander, Joseph, Simon and Angélique, as well as her mother, Marie-Joseph Molleur.&nbsp;&nbsp; They got the distinct impression that this was an act of separation between Malcolm and Marie.&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, who was the mother of Juliana, born later? <br /><br />A document found in the Quebec Register Books, dated 10 July 1773, revealed the sale of land situated at Rivière-du-Loup by Richard Murray to Malcolm Fraser and Margery his wife. &nbsp;&nbsp; It was very intriguing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was this a new wife and the mother of Juliana?&nbsp;&nbsp; What was her family name?&nbsp;&nbsp; The clue was contained in a draft letter, dated 22 July 1814 [Fonds Fraser], written by Malcolm Fraser to John McCord about Juliana and the recent death of Patrick Langan. &nbsp;Malcolm referred to &#8220;your niece and my daughter&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp; The logical conclusion was that the mother of Juliana was a sister of John McCord, merchant of Quebec. &nbsp;&nbsp; Paul found a Margaret McCord married to Josiah Bleakley in Quebec St Andrew&#8217;s in 1798.&nbsp;&nbsp; At her death in 1829, she was 63 years old, so she was born about 1766 and could not have been the mother of Juliana. <br /><br />The last will of John McCord, dated 1st Oct 1817 and probated 26 Jan 1822, revealed that Juliana and Charlotte Langan were named as beneficiaries, but no relationship was given. &nbsp; Nevertheless, it was clear that they were part of the family.&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer finally came in a book about the McCord family written in 1992 and published by the McCord Museum.&nbsp;&nbsp; Malcolm Fraser and Margery McCord had their place in the family chart.&nbsp;&nbsp; On page 31, it was written &#8220;Margery married Malcolm Fraser&#8221;. &nbsp;&nbsp; On page 33, it was noted that John McCord sold the family property &#8220;to his brother-in-law, Malcolm Fraser&#8221; and that Thomas McCord &#8220;placed his affairs in the care of his nephew by marriage, Patrick Langan.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no doubt that Juliana Fraser was the daughter of Malcolm Fraser and Margery McCord, whose sister Jane had married Alexander Fraser of Beauchamp. <br /><br />A chart showing the new family connections of Lieut. Alexander Fraser of the 78th (c1729-1799), Lieut. Malcolm Fraser of the 78th (1733-1815), Volunteer John Ross of the 78th and Thomas McCord, merchant of Quebec (1750-1824), is included in the December 1999 issue of&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian Explorer , together with a chart of the Fraser Family of Mount Murray &amp; Rivière-du-Loup. <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C46">46</a></span>[DBC] <b>FRASER (ffraser), MALCOLM</b>, army and militia officer, seigneur, and office holder; b. 26&nbsp;May&nbsp;1733 in Abernethy, Scotland, son of Donald Fraser and Janet McIntosh; d.&nbsp;14&nbsp;June&nbsp;1815 at Quebec, Lower Canada, and was buried five days later in St&nbsp;Matthew&#8217;s cemetery.<br />In July&nbsp;1757 Malcolm Fraser purchased an ensigncy in the 78th Foot. The following month his regiment landed at Halifax, N.S., and Fraser subsequently took part in the sieges of Louisbourg, Île Royale (Cape Breton Island), and Quebec. When the regiment was disbanded in 1763 he retired on a lieutenant&#8217;s half pay. His loyal services as a soldier entitled him to petition for land. On 27&nbsp;April&nbsp;1762 Governor <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/murray_james_4E.html"><u><font color="#0000ee">Murray*</a></font></u> granted him the seigneury of Mount-Murray, which was situated within the boundaries of the former seigneury of La&nbsp;Malbaie. Only two such grants in fief and seigneury were made by the British government, the other one being given to Fraser&#8217;s companion in arms John <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/nairne_john_5E.html"><u><font color="#0000ee">Nairne</a></font></u>. That same year Fraser rented from Murray part of the seigneury of Île-d&#8217;Orléans including the parishes of Sainte-Famille and Saint-Jean, and in 1766 Murray granted him 3,000 acres at the back of his seigneury of Rivière-du-Loup. During the American Revolutionary War Fraser became a captain and paymaster in the 1st battalion of the Royal Highland Emigrants [see Allan <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/maclean_allan_4E.html"><u><font color="#0000ee">Maclean*</a></font></u>]. He gave the alarm when the Americans who were besieging Quebec launched their attack on 31&nbsp;Dec.&nbsp;1775 under Richard <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/montgomery_richard_4E.html"><u><font color="#0000ee">Montgomery*</a></font></u>. Later his company was stationed mainly in the Montreal and Richelieu valley regions. When his battalion was disbanded in June&nbsp;1784, Fraser again went on half pay, but it was withdrawn five years later because of the discovery of irregularities in his regimental books. He had to wait until 1795 to clear his reputation and again collect his half pay, along with arrears.<br />After the American invasion Fraser continued to acquire landed property. He bought the seigneury of L&#8217;Islet-du-Portage from Gabriel <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/christie_gabriel_4E.html"><u><font color="#0000ee">Christie*</a></font></u> in 1777. Two years later he purchased for £1,000 the portion of Île-d&#8217;Orléans that he rented from Murray. In 1782 he took over part of a long-term lease that Murray had given Henry Caldwell. The territory, which was rented for £90 per annum for the first 11 years and £100 after that, comprised the seigneuries of Rivière-du-Loup and Madawaska and the fief of Île-Rouge. In 1786 he received 3,000 acres in Chatham Township. Fraser also turned out to be one of the major landowners in the Upper Town of Quebec. In the period 1777–91 he bought five houses and lots on Rue des Grisons, between Rue Sainte-Geneviève and Rue Mont-Carmel. His common-law wife, Marie Allaire, herself purchased some land on Rue des Grisons, of which Fraser took over the mortgage. Around 1790 he also acquired the house belonging to merchant John McCord on Rue de la Fabrique. In addition, in 1782 Fraser had set up the Madawaska Company in partnership with Caldwell. He had become a moneylender as well. He lent out the sum of £300 in 1773 and £1,000 in 1784. Three years later he made a loan of £200 to Hugh Blackburn, a miller at Mount-Murray.<br />Thus, beneath the exterior of a landed gentleman, Fraser showed himself to be an astute businessman, whether he was investing in property or putting out money. He did not hesitate to invest even when he had to mortgage his seigneuries. The seigneury of L&#8217;Islet-du-Portage had a mortgage of £400 on it in 1790, and again in 1810. In 1791 there was a mortgage on Mount-Murray made out to surgeon James <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/fisher_james_6E.html"><u><font color="#0000ee">Fisher*</a></font></u>. On occasion Fraser leased his seigneuries, contenting himself with collecting the rent from them.&nbsp;They brought him income from fishing, wheat, saw logs, and seigneurial dues.<br />Fraser was an absentee seigneur. At Quebec he held for many years the office of justice of the peace, to which he was first appointed in 1764. He was a founding member of the Agriculture Society, which was created in 1789, and he became a subscriber to the Fire Society in 1790. Three years earlier he had been appointed a major in the Quebec Battalion of British Militia, a posting he retained until 1794. In May of that year Governor Lord&nbsp;Dorchester [Guy <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/carleton_guy_5E.html"><u><font color="#0000ee">Carleton</a></font></u>] promoted him colonel in the Kamouraska battalion of militia, and in 1805 he was colonel of the Baie-Saint-Paul battalion of militia. During the War of 1812, despite his advanced years Fraser led the militiamen from Baie-Saint-Paul to Quebec.<br />By 1803 Fraser had begun divesting himself of his real estate, giving his son Simon his 3,000 acres in Chatham Township on condition that Simon secure letters patent. Two years later he sold his share in the seigneury of Île-d&#8217;Orléans to Louis Poulin, a miller at Sainte-Famille. Finally, in 1810, he gave his son Joseph his seigneury of L&#8217;Islet-du-Portage.<br />One of Fraser&#8217;s biographers, William Stewart <a href="javascript%3Avoid(0)"><u><font color="#0000ee">Wallace*</a></font></u>, asserts that he had numerous illegitimate children, five of them with Marie Allaire, who came from the seigneury of Beaumont. Three other children, Ann, William, and John <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/link_choose.php?cand=5122+7565+4875+7602+7719+2151+6254+6008+7559"><u><font color="#0000ee">Malcolm*</a></font></u>, were born later of his liaison with Marguerite Ducros, dit Laterreur, who was from the seigneury of Mount-Murray. In his will, dated 4&nbsp;Nov.&nbsp;1811, Fraser bequeathed an annual pension to her and divided his Canadian estate among all his children.<br /><a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/contrib/5"><u><font color="#0000ee">Yvon Desloges </a></font></u><br />ANQ-Q, CN1-103, 3&nbsp;sept.&nbsp;1765; CN1-205, 19&nbsp;déc.&nbsp;1777, 10&nbsp;août&nbsp;1784; CN1-224, 6&nbsp;mai&nbsp;1786; CN1-245, 11&nbsp;mai&nbsp;1780, 3&nbsp;août&nbsp;1784; CN1-256, 17&nbsp;March, 25&nbsp;May&nbsp;1791; 5&nbsp;July, 1&nbsp;Sept.&nbsp;1794; 6&nbsp;Oct.&nbsp;1795; CN1-262, 11&nbsp;déc.&nbsp;1795; CN1-284, 22&nbsp;juill.&nbsp;1791; P-81; P-297.
