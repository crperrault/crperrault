<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1254">1254</a></span>  Frangois Saucier, architect of the stone fort of Fort de Chartres. That it was Frangois is <br />definitely established by a letter of F. Saucier, engineer sent to Illinois, to Vaudreuil, January 20, <br />1752. HMLO, 329. This credit has long been given to Jean Baptiste Saucier, and chiefly on the <br />authority of Dr. John F. Snyder, who in the 1919 Transactions of the Illinois State Historical <br />Society published a long article on &quot;Captain John Baptiste Saucier at Fort Chartres in the <br />Illinois, 1751-1763.&quot; Labeled as history, and supposedly based on documents destroyed in a fire a <br />century ago, the romantic tale of young Jean Baptiste is a pure figment of imagination, full of <br />errors at every turn. According to Dr. Snyder, who says he is a descendent of Jean, the youth <br />was born in France and fell in love with his foster sister, Adel Lepage. He was sent to Illinois <br />where he fell in love with Eulalie, Commandant Macarty's daughter, but she died tragically of <br />some lung disease; then Jean Baptiste, returning to New Orleans, learned that Adel, coming to <br />Louisiana, had contracted the plague on board ship and died. But she was not dead, and some- <br />time later, on the night before the Illinois convoy was due to set out in Jean Baptiste's charge, he <br />discovered her working as a poor seamstress in the mansion of her cousins, the Delormes, in New <br />Orleans. They were married the next morning at the Ursuline chapel and spent their honeymoon <br />on the Illinois-bound batteau! <br /><br />Actually there were three Saucier brothers in Illinois: Henri, Jean Baptiste, and Frangois, <br />sons of Jean Baptiste Saucier and Gabrielle Savary of Mobile. La. Hist. Quaii., VIII, 484. Their <br />mother married a second time to Pierre Vivareinne, who had died by 1736. She died by 1738, <br />leaving two sons in Illinois, one aged twenty-nine, the other twenty-seven — probably Henri and <br />Jean Baptiste — and two minor sons, probably Jean Baptiste and Frangois Vivareinne. <br /><br />Henri Saucier was the husband of Barbe la Croix, daughter of Frangois la Croix and <br />Barbe Montmeunier of St. Philippe. On February 6, 1733, he bought three arpents of land from <br />his father-in-law. (Document quoted from Kaskaskia Mss. in ///. Hist. Soc, Trans., XX, 261.) <br /><br />Jean Baptiste Saucier married Marie Rose Girardy in April, 1740. La. Hist. Qtiart., X, <br />274. He died in Illinois in 1747 leaving two minor children, and his widow married Louis Vernay. <br /><br />The wife of Frangois Saucier was Marie Jeanne Fontaille; in July, 1761, after the death of <br />Frangois, she married Antoine de Selle Duclos, cadet I'aiguillette, son of Monsieur Alexandre <br />Duclos and Elizabeth Michelle. The parish register of Ste. Anne which gives the above infor- <br />mation, includes also an entry for February 19, 1752, when Frangois Saucier, &quot;engineer,&quot; was <br />godfather to Marie Frangoise, daughter of his half-brother, Jean Baptiste Vivareinne and Marie <br />Anne St. Pierre. A son of Frangois Saucier, also called Frangois, was born about 1740, was in <br />command of Fort Massac when it surrendered to the English in 1765, and was the father of <br />twenty-two children. Houck, History of Missouri, II, 89.</div>
