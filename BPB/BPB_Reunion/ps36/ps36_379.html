<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for George Thomas</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C2148">2148</a></span> 5th son of John Thomas, grocer, on Bristol Bridge, founder of wholesale house of Thomas and Sons, resident of Prior Park, Bath, who married Elizabeth Ovens, and had a family of 10 ch, of whom eight grew up to mature years -- John, Benjamin, Alfred, Samuel, George, Edward, Joseph and Maria (all but Joseph passed away by 1870).  George was b Oct 31, 1791 at the shop on the bridge and educated at Burford. <br /><br />Hannah Rose (nee Thomas), a sister of the gf of George, says &#8220;I have heard father say that his grandfather Edward Evans, was a prisoner of conscience sake 18 months; and his wite Catherine Evans, continued a prisoner for 5 years from her first commitment&#8221;. We presume this to be the Katherine Evans, who was in the inquisition at Malta, for whom George Fox interceded successfully with &#8220;one called Lord D&#8217;Aubeny&#8221;.. The youngest daughter of these sufferers for the truts was Priscilla, and was very young at the death of her father, who left special directions as to her education.  .. while in the service of the Countess Conway, married Robert Thomas, who is described as a sober man, but not a Friend;  they lived a Llanerchroch Well, near Welchpool, and had five sons.  The father dying while these were but young, the second son was put with a relation , Thomas Oliver, a farmer.  Many hardships,   Young Thomas went as a shepherd lad to Charles Lloyds at Dolobran, where he continued till he was 18 years of age.  ... sent as a servant to Edward Lloyd a wine merchant at Bristol.  After serving Lloyd for 2 years, he went in1706 to learn the trade of a malt mill maker with Abraham Darby, at Baptist Mills, who in conjunction with other Friends, Edward Lloyd, Benjamin Cole, Arthur Thomas, and John Andrews, had begun that business, after adding to it that o iron and brass founders.  <br /><br />Thomas and Darby invent new process for making pots, which Darby patents in 1707.  Thomas agrees to work for Darby for 3 years, and agrees to never disclose the secret of the process.  <br /><br />They move to Coalbrookdale.  He marries Grace Zeane at Friends Meeting House 6 Mo 26th 1717 [really 1714], he being 27 years of age.  He died in 1760.  Some of his descendants continued as valued agents of the family down to 1828.  <br /><br />One of his sons, Samuel, came to Keynsham, and settled there as a wire drawer; he m Esther Derrick, af the Friends Meeting House 2 Mo 24th 1746, to whom was b in 1752 John Thomas, who commenced business as a grocer on the Somersetshire side of Bristol Bridge, and in after years established the .. wholesale house of John Thomas and Sons in Redcliffe St.  He was a good mechanic, a self-taught hydraulic engineer, and when... in 1793 the whole country ran into a perfect mania on the question of canals, he took the lead as one of the chief promoters of different schemes in the south of England.  <br /><br />In 1801 we find him one of a committee of five who seek to make the Somersetshire Coal Canal.  ... He took a deep interest in the Kennett and Avon canal, which was designed to connect Bath, Devizes, Hungerford, Newbury, and Reading, with London and became from the first one of the committee of management.  The venture cost much more than expected.  John Thomas took on the sole superintendence at £750 p.a., which included all expenses.  <br /><br />In 1811 he was one of the promoters of a canal to connect the Avon an the Tone, his sone John, Benjamin and Alfred being also on the share list.  In the same year, also, in conjunction with others, an Act was obtained for making a navigable canal between Bath and Bristol and also for supplying the latter city with water.  ... Power was taken to make water-works, to break up the ground to lay pipes, make reservoirs, etc but though this part of the bill was not carried out, that which canalized the river Avon was at once begun and became a prolific source of wealth to the shareholders, there being no excavation, few locks, and the canal bearing the same mileage toll as the Kennett and Avon, constructed as so heavy and ruinous a cost.  It is, we believe, no secret that the last share in private hands of this canal was held by his son, the late George Thomas, who demurred to the sale thereof, and wished to retain it; but the Kennett and Avon Co being determined to purchase, offered him £5000 for that which originally cost £100 and we need scarcely add the offer was accepted.<br /><br />After Mr Thomas [John?] had resigned the active duties of superintendent, he gave his disinterested attention to the conduct and management of the affairs of the company, down to within a very short period of his death.  Until the advent of the Great Western Railway this canal became the artery along which the traffic of the terminal cities and great towns on its banks incessantly flowed. <br /><br />In 1812, still retaining his shares in the Bristol wholesale house, John Thomas retired from all active duties to Prior Park, which he had purchased and there for 15 yeas as the almoner of the divine bounty, he spent a mellow and happy old age.  He died in March 1827. [notes from obit in Bristol paper] <br /><br />GT in 1846 becomes Director of the Company that supplied Bristol&#8217;s water.  On 9 Jan 1858 he becomes chairman.  <br /><br />In 1813 a few gentlemen of Bristol, availing themselvess of the talents of John Breillat, formed a company for lighting the city, incorporated on 23 Mar 1819.  Among the names of the proprietors one finds Benjamin Thomas, elder br and partner of George, who was also a subscriber, as we find him a registered shareholder in 1823 and Director in 1830.  In 1823 another company was formed in Bristol for making gas from oil, and of this a younger br and partner, Edward Thomas, became a promoter.  In 1853 these companies were united as the Bristol Gas Light Co.  George Thomas was chosen as first Chairman, an office he held till his death.  <br /><br />GT had begun his career in the wholesale house in Redcliffe St in connection with his father and br Benjamin, Samuel and Edward.  His father died in 1827 and in 1830, another of the firm passed to his eternal rest.  Benjamin, the eldest, who had m Harriet Sanderson, and was considered most like his father , under medical advice sailed to eh West Indies, but d on his passage Dec 1 1831, his son, the present John Sanderson Thomas, succeeding him in the business.  <br /><br />Wilberforce, Sharp, Dilwyn, and above all Clarkson, had stirred up the foul question of slavery before GT appeared on the scene, and Clarkson, whilst he had unmasked the iniquity and cruelties of the trade as carried on in Bristol ships, had also made, esp among the quakers of Bristol, many firm friends.  The battle was at its hottest when GT was a boy, and it enlisted all his ardent sympathies.  In his 16th year he exulted in the abolition of the trade w Africa, so far as it was carried on by English ships and seamen.  Four years of active exerttion.. compelled .. Parliament, on the motion of Mr Brougham, to declare the slave travde to be a felony punishable by 14 yrs transportation.  In 1824 it was made a capital offense by the name of piracy.  In 1833 the Act for the Abolition of Slavery throughout the British Empire received royal assent and on 1 Aug 1838, ... all men were freed throughout the empire.<br /><br />On Feb 16 1831 he m Elizabeth Greer, of Rhone Hill near Dungannon, County Tyrone. <br /><br />Within 20 days of his marriage GT presided a t meeting to erect the Bristol General Hospital. It opened in 1832 and he supported it.  A larger one was built in 1845 with support of Joseph Eaton.  GT provided £6200 to it.<br /><br /><br />In 1834 the retail house passed from the hands of Alfred Thomas to the firm of Wedmore and Claypole.  On 13 Dec 1834, died Elizabeth Thomas, at 86, the parent. She was a sister of Cyrus Ovens.  Her eldest son John who was never in business d in May 1836.  <br /><br />On 26 Dec 1835 GT was elected one of the town councillors for the ward of Redcliffe. He served for 17 yrs.  <br /><br />Samuel died in Oct 1840 of an attack of erysipelas of the head.  Alfred d in April 1846.  <br /><br />In 1838, GT provided 1000£ to acquire a plot of land that had been used for an annual fair but turned into a hotbed of vice.  <br /><br />GT advocated for the repeal of he Beer Shops Act, for abolition of capital punishment, against calling out the militia during the French invasion panic of 1852, on the Reform Bill.  Early supporter of Liberal Association.  Supported his brother Edward in temperance cause.  <br /><br />Edward Thomas d at his residence in Charlotte St on 28 Dec ?? at 60, leaving a large property sworn to be under £120K to his br GT.  GTs investments with a view to pecuniary gain, were confined to canals and wholesale grocery.  In the former, he became, when the Kennett and Avon Co was absorbed by the Great Western Railway Co, the largest receiver of rent-charge; in the latter he made most of his wealth.  He invested in a gigantic sugar refinery at Counterslip.  He was an investor in the Gas Co and the Water Works Co, the South Wales Union Railway, the Clifton suepension bridge, the Leigh Woods Buiding Co (chairman), the St Philip;s Bridge Co.  He was a subscriber in the building of COlston Hall.  <br /><br />In 1840 he moved to his newly purchased home Eagle House, Brislington,  Dies Dec 7 1868?, bur 14th at Friends&#8217; burial ground,Rosemary St.  John Sanderson Thomas was residuary legatee.</div>
