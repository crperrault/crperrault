<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Charles Michel D'irumberry De Salaberry</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Heros de Chateauguay.  Son epouse etait sa cousine.<br /><br />[DBC] Army and militia officer, politician, seigneur, office holder, and JP.  Four sons and 3 daughters.<br /><br />[DBC] Enlisted at the age of 14 and participated, between 1792 and 1805 in campaigns in West Indies, where his commissions were helped by his friendship with the Duke of Kent. By 1803, he had a company and the rank of Captain-lieutenant.  <br /><br />Early in 1806 he was transferred to the 60th Foot, under Col.  Francis de Rottenberg.  At the Duke's request he conducted recruiting in Britain for the 1st Foot in 1806-7.  Brigade-major of light infantry brigade under Rottenberg in Netherlands in 1809, where he caught contagious fever.  <br /><br />Returned to Canada in 1810 as ADC to Maj. Gen. Rottenberg.  Brevet- major in 1811. <br /><br />In 1812, he got approval to set up a militia corps, the Voltigeurs Canadiens.   At the beginning the recruitment of militiamen succeeded <br /><br />beyond all hopes, on account of the economic crisis, Salaberry's reputation, and the fact that the Select Embodied Militia had not yet been raised.  Notwithstanding the claims sometimes made, exaggerated notions that S. deserves all the credit for recruiting and that the unit was raised in two days are untenable.  At the Battle of Chateauguau, the Voltigeurs had 29 officers and 481 NCOs and men.  <br /><br />S was a strict and conscientious commander.  His brother-in-law, JBR Hertel de Rouville, who was also a captain in the Voltigeurs, begged to be transferred to another regiment because he found his commanding officer too demanding. <br /><br />In Nov 1812, the Voltigeurs Canadiens were called into action in repelling an invasion at Lacolle.  S was praised for his conduct in commanding an advance guard, but in July 1813, he learned that Prevost had sent the British Gov a dispatch making no mention of his name and praising the Adjutant General, Edward Baynes, and Maj Gen Rottenberg, who had taken no part in the action.  Other missions followed in Swanton, VT, Champlain NY, Plattsburgh NY, and at Four Corners, near Chateauguay.  Disappointed with the missions given him, S wanted to leave the army.  But he was then summoned to Chateauguay where the Americans were preparing to attack Montréal in order to cut off the British Army in Upper Canada.  By shrewd tactics, S managed to create the illusion that his force was much stronger than it actually was and thus discouraged the enemy.  After 4 hours of fighting the Americans retreated.  The Canadians remained in place, ready to fight the next day.  But Gen Hampton, who had received orders to take up winter quarters in American territory, thought that his superior Maj Gen Wilkinson, had called off the attack on Montréal and moved his troops back towards the US. His actions were based on a misunderstanding, but having learned of Hampton's defeat, Wilkinson did not want to attack Montréal.<br /><br />Salaberry's superior, MG von Wattenwyl, and Prevost arrived at the same time to observe the enemy's retreat.  After the battle, the Canadians thought they had faced 6-7000 Americans, but in fact 3000 Americans had faced about 1700 Canadians.  According to Prevost's report, written on the day of the battle, 300 Canadians had met 7500 Americans.  From then on, the battle of Chateeauguay took on a legendary character and became a source of popular pride.  If people found reasons for pride in Prevost's order, S saw in it an intention to cheat him of credit for the victory.  Indeed Prevost said that he himself had been present at the battle, and gave Wattenwyl credit for the strategy.  Humiliated, S made innumerable attempts to obtain recognition from the authorities and promotion in the Army.  He almost resigned from the army, but finally received thanks from the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council in early 1814.  In March 1814, Prevost recommended him for appointment as inspecting field officer of the militia, but in a conidential report in May, he disparaged him, accusing him of negligence and claiming that he had only been following Wattenwyl's orders.  That appointment was not confirmed and S sent his resignation, which was intercepted by the Duke of Kent. He retained his appointemnt and remained Lt Col of the Voltigeurs.  The war ended on 24 Dec 1814, but the news did not reach the colony till the spring.  <br /><br />In 116, S received a medal commemorating Chateauguay.  In 1817, he was made companion of the Order of Bath.  In 1819, he joined his father on the Legislative Council.  He supported the petition against the Union Bill of 1822, but in 1824 wrote to VIger that he expected the union of Lower and Upper Canada to come about.  <br /><br />He managed a sizeable estate, obtained from his family's and his wife's, including the fiefs of St-Mathias and Beaulac, and (much of?)  the seigneury of Chambly.  With friend and neighbor Samuel Hatt and others, he invested in a steamship, the De Salaberry, which plied between Montréal, Québec, and Chambly from Aug 1821 until it burned off Cap Rouge in June 1823, killing 6 or 7 people and a very valuable cargo was lost.</div>
