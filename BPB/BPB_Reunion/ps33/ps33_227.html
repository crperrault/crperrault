<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Frederick Dohrmann</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><a href="http://cdn.calisphere.org/data/13030/g2/tf100001g2/files/tf100001g2.pdf">http://cdn.calisphere.org/data/13030/g2/tf100001g2/files/tf100001g2.pdf</a><br /><br />Frederick W. Dohrmann was born in Germany in 1842 and came to Davenport, Iowa in 1858. In April of 1862, he settled in San Francisco where he worked as a clerk in a grocery store located at Fifth and Howard. He became involved in the general merchandise business in Oakland and in the manufacturing of breakfast foods. In 1868, Mr. Dohrmann gave up the milling business and entered into a partnership with Bernard Nathan of B. Nathan Company, engaged in the selling of fine crockery. From this organization, in 1887, evolved Nathan, Dohrmann &amp; Company. At the helm were Mr. B. Nathan, who spent most of his time abroad scouting suppliers of fine china, and Mr. Dohrmann, who remained as manager in San Francisco. The Dohrmann Commercial Company, with Mr. Dohrmann serving as president, appears to be contemporaneous with the Nathan Dohrmann Company. In 1898, Mr. Dohrmann's son, A. B. C. Dohrmann, became a partner in the Nathan Dohrmann Company. From this time forward, he was closely connected with and played an important role in the various Dohrmann stores.<br />The Emporium, the first department store in California, was founded in 1896. It operated for a year as a group of individually-owned shops in a building owned by the Parrott estate. However, in 1897, due to difficulties ensuing from the lack of centralized management, the Emporium merged with the Golden Rule Bazaar, becoming the Emporium and Golden Rule Bazaar. In 1898, Mr. Dohrmann's son, A. B. C. Dohrman became officially involved in Mr. Dohrmann, along with others, was instrumental in the reorganization of the new Emporium and was president of the company at the time of his death in 1914. In 1927, the Emporium merged with the Oakland store, H.C. Capwell. Mr. Dohrmann was also one of the organizers of the San Francisco Hotel Company, which operated the St. Francis Hotel, and one of the founders and president of the Merchants' Association. He held a directorship in the Savings Union Bank and Trust Company of San Francisco and served, at various times, as a director for several of the Dohrmann Commercial Company's syndicate stores. In addition, Mr. Dohrmann was involved in a number of civic activities, including serving as a member of the Park Commission and as a University of California regent. He worked in the Relief and Red Cross effort at the time of the San Francisco 1906 earthquake and fire, and was deeply interested in the Red Cross Society, the German Benevolent Society and the German Altenheim and served in a number of capacities on various charitable committees.</div>
