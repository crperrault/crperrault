<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Gordon Edward Trueman MD</div>

<div class="psNotesData">[Obit, Globe and Mail] Saturday January 22, 2011<br />GORDON EDWARD TRUEMAN - BA, MD, FRCPC Passed away unexpectedly at Arbutus Manor, in Vancouver, on Sunday, January 9, 2011. In the previous week he attended the Salute to Vienna concert with the Strauss Symphony of Canada, ordered tickets to the opera and wrote a short story for the Manor's newspaper. After sixty-five years of a loving marriage Gordon was predeceased by his wife, Carol. He is survived by his five children: John (Linda), Mark (Ruth) Barbara (Bill), Vicki (Richard) and Carlie; by his seven grandchildren Kimberley (Mark) Nill, Kelley (Doug) Stuart, Mark (Penny Korethoski), Jeremy, Matthew (Genne Seto) Green, Nancy (Ashley) Hegland and Douglas; by eight great-grandchildren: Yanik, Torin and Braea Nill, Andraya and Karsten Stuart, Sadie and Mabel Green and Waverley Hegland, extended family and many nieces and nephews and their families. He was born in 1913 in Winnipeg to Harry and Eliza Trueman. His four older brothers, John, Mark, Jim and Stan, all born in England, referred to him as 'the kid'. Despite harrowing adventures as a boy while skating on the Red River (he was brought home twice by the police) and canoeing hundreds of miles with the YMCA, he survived and went on to study Mathematics and Physics at the University of Manitoba. In 1939, he graduated in Medicine at the University of Manitoba, interned at Vancouver General Hospital and then trained in Diagnostic Radiology making him the fourth radiologist in British Columbia. He was a Major in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps in World War II and went overseas leaving Carol with three children under the age of four. Twelve days after DDay he landed in Normandy with the 12th General Hospital. Although always reluctant to discuss the war, late in life he spoke of the Falaise Gap, starvation in Holland and the Battle of the Scheldt. He came home from the war with tuberculosis. After many months of hospital care, he was sent to the TB sanatorium at Tranquille, near Kamloops. Upon recovery, he joined the Irving Clinic and founded the Department of Radiology at the Royal Inland Hospital. Gordon and Carol described their five years in Kamloops as the best years of their lives. In 1952, he returned to Vancouver to continue the practice of medicine. In 1976, he retired as Associate Professor at the University of British Columbia and Head of Radiology at Vancouver General Hospital. Gordon served on many community boards and gave generously to a wide variety of charities, including the University of British Columbia. He and Carol were founding and active members of the Arbutus Club where they were involved in social events and avid curlers. Along with others, Gordon and Carol founded the community of Maracaibo on Salt Spring Island where he designed and built a vacation home. He and Carol spent many happy times sharing Maracaibo with their family when they were not travelling in Portugal and Spain, vacationing in Hawaii or fly fishing on the rivers and lakes of British Columbia. In his last five years at Arbutus Manor he participated on the Council and contributed stories to the Manor's paper. He found particular pleasure in hosting many lunches, dinners and visits with all members of the family. The family wish to extend their appreciation and thanks to all the staff at Arbutus Manor who befriended, cared for him and taught him to use e-mail. His inquiring mind, wisdom and counsel inspired us all. He will be missed by his family and all those who knew him. A Memorial Service will be held at Shaughnessy United Church, 1550 West 33rd Avenue, Vancouver, on February 28, 2011 at 1:30 p.m. A reception will follow at the Arbutus Club, 2001 Nanton Avenue, Vancouver from 2:30 - 4:30. In lieu of flowers donations may be made in the name of The Dr. Gordon E. Trueman Radiology Residents and Fellows Research Award Endowment with cheques payable to UBC Faculty of Medicine, 317-2194 Health Sciences Mall, Vancouver, B.C. V6T 1Z3.</div>
