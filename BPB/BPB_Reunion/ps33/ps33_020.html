<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Sir Adrian William Maxwell BAILLIE 6th Bart</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><a href="http://www.enotes.com/topic/Harthill,_Scotland">http://www.enotes.com/topic/Harthill,_Scotland</a><br /><br />6th Baronet Sir Aidrian William Maxwell Baillie (Brother of YY) died in 1947. Sir Adrian William Maxwell Baillie of Polkemmet, 6th Bt. was born on 5 May 1898. He was the son of Sir Robert Alexander Baillie of Polkemmet, 4th Bt. and Isabel Wilkie. Sir Adrian William Maxwell Baillie of Polkemmet, 6th Bt. succeeded to the title of 6th Baronet Baillie, of Polkemmet, Linlithgowshire on 7 September 1914. He gained the rank of Lieutenant in the service of the 2nd Dragoons, Scots Greys. He was in the Diplomatic Service between 1921 and 1928. He held the office of Member of Parliament (M.P.) for Linlithgowshire between 1931 and 1935. He also held the office of Member of Parliament for Tonbridge between 1937 and 1945. He married Hon. Olive Cecilia Paget, daughter of Almeric Hugh Paget, 1st and last Baron Queenborough and Pauline Payne Whitney, on 4 November 1931. He (6th Bt) and Hon. Olive Cecilia Paget were divorced in 1944. He died on 8 January 1947 at age 48. She died on 9 September 1974.<br /><br />One of the most notable members of the Baillie family was the 6th Baronet of Polkemmet, Sir Adrian. He was Depute Lord Lieutenant of West Lothian and Justice of the Peace. He became Conservative MP for the Linlithgowshire constituency (1931 - 1935) when in 1931 he succeeded a defeat on the Labour candidate Emmanuel 'Manny' Shinwell. Afterwards he married Cecilia (Olive) Wilson-Filmer, the eldest daughter of Lord Queensborough. She reputedly had an income of around £50,000 pounds per year from her Grandfather W.C Whitney, an American multimillionaire. As an MP Sir Aidrian then spent more time in London and Leeds castle in Kent as Olive owed property. The Baillie family ceased to be resident at Polkemmet from around this time therefore from this time it can be assumed Polkemmet house and estate began to decline. Olive Baillie bought Leeds Castle in 1926 with her sister, Dorothy Paget. The castle had fallen into disrepair, but was soon restored and it was furnished with an outstanding collection of French and English furniture, tapestries and pictures. Gawaine inherited the estate surrounding the castle on his mother's death in 1974; the castle itself was subsequently bequeathed to the nation.<br />During the war Polkemmet House was used both as a war hospital and accommodation for Polish Soldiers who had fled Nazi-occupied Poland to fight for Britain.<br />Sir Adrian Baillie the 6th Baronet died in 1947 and was interred in the mausoleum within the estate which can be seen there today. The family connection with the estate after three centuries ends at this time.<br />The 7th Baronet grew up in Leeds where his father had moved to when an MP. He lived in Sussex and eventually became an amateur racing driver. He competed in bobsleigh and on the Cresta Run at St Moritz, while studying accountancy and then engineering at Eton. Died 2003 aged 69. At this time his Engineering sub contractor company HPC Engineering at Burgess Hill, West Sussex had a annual turnover of £25 million pounds.<br />In 1945 Polkemmet House then became the 'Trefoil School' originated during the war when a group of people associated with the Girl Guide movement volunteered to take care of handicapped evacuee children there. It was officially opened as the Trefoil School on 25 September by HRH The Princess Elizabeth (Now HM The Queen). She later became the school's patron. The Trefoil School remained here until 1951 when it moved to Gogarburn, Edinburgh. During this time at Polkemmet the school was visited by some important visitors including, Chief Guide Lord Rowallan and Princess Mary, the Princess Royal. Following the buildings use as the Trefoil hospital it became the Scottish Police training school before being demolished by the National Coal Board who were more interested in the coal underneath than period buildings.<br />The contrast between the standard of living of the wealthy Baillie family throughout the period and that of the ordinary workers in the area was indeed stark.</div>
