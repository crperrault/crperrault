<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C231">231</a></span> [bap] P: Sen C P Beaubien, M: Lucile Delamare Mage?<br />Signe Laurette Beaubien, Frances Beaubien, Margaret Beaubien, Elmire Tarut, ??<br /><br /><a href="https://ottawacitizen.remembering.ca/obituary/charles-beaubien-1079228653">https://ottawacitizen.remembering.ca/obituary/charles-beaubien-1079228653</a><br />It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Charles Douglas Beaubien on May 16th, 2020 at St Patrick's Nursing Home in Ottawa. <br />Born in Montreal on April 16, 1932, he was predeceased by his parents, the Hon. Senator Louis Philippe Beaubien and Frances Helene Beaubien (nee Douglas) and sister, Margot, Lady Baillie. <br />Charles was the beloved husband of Kathleen Turnbull and adored father of Claire, Suzanne and Paul, the children he shared with his former wife, Andrea Russell. He was also a much loved stepfather to Lorna and Karen. Cherished grandfather of Bronwyn, Rhiannon, Gareth and Carlos. <br />Perfectly mannered to the end, in his last years he was known at St Patrick's Home as the 'Distinguished Gentleman' and he truly was. Charles was immensely kind and loving, gentle and honest with a sharp wit. <br />A lifelong scholar, Charles received his first diploma in Civil Engineering from McGill University in 1955, and over the next three years worked as a hydroelectric engineer in Montreal before being offered a scholarship to the Centre d'Etudes Industielles in Geneva, an international management school, where his work centred on international aid programs. <br />In 1958-59 he instructed in McGill's Engineering Faculty and began the study of philosophy at the University of Montreal, where he graduated magna cum laude, winning the Lieutenant Governor's Medal with his L.Ph. (1961). After much time abroad, studying in Paris, Germany and Oxford, where he concentrated on the Platonic tradition, he returned to the University of Montreal, where he taught philosophy from 1966 to 1970. <br />Charles became keenly interested in city planning and furthered his studies in planning at the University of Montreal and began to be active in urban politics. In 1970, he joined Beauchemin - Beaton - Lapointe engineers and planning consultants as Chief of Planning, where he managed various regional projects including the master planning of Forillon, the first National Park in Quebec. <br />In 1974, he joined the Science Council of Canada as a Science Advisor. His work centred on questions of land use and agriculture, food and other resources, as well as of technology transfer and the supply of highly trained manpower. <br />Charles joined Environment Canada in March 1981 as Senior Policy Advisor and only left to attend Harvard University's Kennedy School in Sept. 1981. He then joined Agriculture Canada as a senior policy advisor and specialized in social and environmental policy. He was made a director and represented Ottawa with a departmental Branch of almost 1000 employees stationed on the Prairies (Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration) and which was active in advancing the economic and environmental well-being of that area. <br />Charles retired from civil service in 1994 and began a new study of theology at St. Paul University, obtaining yet another Master's Degree in Biblical Studies. For ten years he was continuously active as a volunteer at the soup kitchen of the Shepherds of Good Hope, just one of the many organisations and charities, including Oxfam Quebec where he was one of the original founders, to which Charles dedicated his time and expertise throughout his life. <br />A deeply thoughtful man, Charles became profoundly interested in the idea of a Sustainable Peace. He worked tirelessly researching and documenting how the world might achieve this. <br />The family wish to thank St Patrick's Nursing home for the excellent care they gave Charles, making his battle with Alzheimer's as dignified and loving as possible. <br />Please remember Charles as the wonderful man you knew, and in his honour donate to the charity of your choice if you wish, and make your contribution to peace in the world. <br />A Celebration of Life will be announced at a later date. <br />Published on May 23, 2020</div>
