<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Dr Antonius Yusuf Manasseh</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Anotnios Manasseh was born in Lebanon and graduated from American University in Beirut as a pharmacist in 1895.  He then worked with his brother, Dr Beshara Manasseh.  Dr. Beshara had graduated from AUB&#8217;s first class of medical doctors in 1877 and met Theophilos Waldmeier (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophilus_Waldmeier">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophilus_Waldmeier</a>)  who was a missionary who had fled Abysynia to Levant (Lebanon). Waldmeier was meeting Cybil &amp; Eli Jones from Maine who had come to establish Quaker presence in the rush of missionaries in the 1870s. Dr. Beshara became a Friend and took his brothers Antonios and Spiridon to Brummana where he founded the first Hospital and Antonios and Spiridon went through high school (Waldmeir had founded Brummana High School, which still exists (<a href="http://www.bhs.edu.lb/">http://www.bhs.edu.lb/</a>)). <br /><br />Hettie and Antonios must have met in UK when Antonios was doing his medical studies at Leeds University, from which he graduated in 1905.  They were likely married in Lebanon ca 1909 and had two children, George Antonius and Dorothy in 1910-11.  Hettie, Dorothy and George returned to London at the onset of WW I as the Turks were on the side of the Axis.  Antonios stayed in Lebanon and practiced medicine till his death in 1929, making frequent visits to London to see his family.<br /><br />He was called Tanius, and is mentioned as such in a letter from John T Dorland to Spiridon Manasseh of 1895.

Not in British Library or Stanford, or Google Books or Amazon)<u><br /><br /></font></u>[British Medical Journal, Aug 15, 1931] A short but detailed and attractive biography of Dr. Antonius Manasseh has now been prepared by C. G. NAISH, principal of the Brummana High School in the Lebanon; for the many friends in this country and in Syria of a medical pioneer who won high esteem as superintendent of the medical work of the Friends Foreign Mlssion -Association, and in connexion with the Syrian and Palestine Relief Fund. He was once described in the British Medical Journal as &quot; a bridge between individuals and peoples who misunderstood one another.&quot; Dr. Manasseh was largely concerned-with the introduction of modern medicine into a country where the age of magic was still continuing. The biography indicates how he was able to achieve his great success; it will be welcomed by many who had no previous knowledge of a very humble and most energetic member of the British  Medical Association, who was equally at home in the East and in the West.<br /><br />[Tony Manasseh, personal communication 100828]<br />Date: Sat, 28 Aug 2010 12:16:47 -0700 (PDT)<br />From: Tony Manasseh &lt;<a href="mailto:tpmanasseh@yahoo.com">tpmanasseh@yahoo.com</a>&gt;<br />Subject: Re: Benington-Manasseh family genealogy<br />To: Ray Perrault &lt;<a href="mailto:perrault@AI.SRI.COM">perrault@AI.SRI.COM</a>&gt;<br />X-Brightmail-Tracker: AAAAAA==<br />X-SRI-SPAM-LEVEL: <br />X-SRI-SPAM-STATUS: No, score=0.0 threshold=8.0<br /><br />Spiridon who was another Pharmacist at the mission and responsible for the hospital pharmacy at the school in Brummana.

However, Auntie Hettie, Dorothy and George left Lebanon at the onset of WW1 for London as British were asked to leave when lebanon, under the Turks, was not with allied forces. They styed there and made their lives there. Dr. ANtonios (husband and father) remained in Lebanon and practiced medicine (graduated from Leeds University in 1905) and took frequent trips to London to see his family. Christopher Naish later wrote a biography of Dr. Antonios and his remarkable work during WW1 and after. Died in 1929.<br />&gt; You can call me anytime.

I was recently researching the lives of Arthur's siblings and came across Henrietta (1874-1960), for whom I found a probate record in England indicating she had been married to an Antonius Yusuf Manasseh of Brummana Lebanon.  Her executor was George Antonius Manasseh (her son?) who could be the George A Manasseh who married in Birminghan in 1925 and died in London in 1974. Family lore had it that either Henrietta or her husband or both had been missionaries in Syria.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;  I couldn't find Henrietta in either the 1891 or 1901 UK census, which leads me to believe she had left England some time before the turn of the century, and since I can't find her marriage or George Antonius's birth in England, I suspect she would have been married in Lebanon.<br />&gt;  &gt;<br />&gt;&gt;  Given Henrietta's Quaker background, when I found you and your connection to Brummana High School, I suspected you might be related. Am I right?<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;  Best regards,<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;  Ray Perrault<br />&gt;&gt;  Palo Alto, California<br /><br />--------------<br />[Phjilip Manasseh, personal communication, 100831]<br /><br />Dear Ray, Antonius came to London to complete his medical training, obtaining the degrees of M.R.C.S and L.R.C.P in 1897, and in the biography it simply says&quot;While in London he met his future wife ,Henrietta Benington,daughter of George Benington, at Enfield She was then being trained as a nurse. It was arranged that he should go to Syria first ,and that she should spend some time in preparation for sharing his work&quot;<br />Eventually they were married in the Quaker Meeting House of the school on November 1st 1899.<br />This last sentence is my assumption for it seems Henrietta lived in the hospital on arrival looked after by the Matron learning the language , and customs while my grandfather was travelling .<br /><br />Regards<br />Philip<br /><br /><br />------------<br /><br />Friends Intelligencer Vol 51 p 106 1894 has article on the state of QUakers in Syria.<br /><br />[Obit, London Times<br /><br />Dr. Antonius J.
