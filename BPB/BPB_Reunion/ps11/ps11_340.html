<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Anne Martin</div>

<div class="psNotesData">[Henry Best, DBC] Anne n'etait probablement pas la fille d'Abraham Martin.  <br /><br />[Jette]  origine inconnue<br /><br />-----------<br />To: Jack Langlois<br /><br />Jack, Here are some things I learned  since my first message concerning Anne Martin who married Jean Cote November 17, 1635.:<br /><br />1) Tanquay say she was born 1614 and  lists her parents as Abraham Martin(born about 1587) and Marguerite Langlois(born about 1592)..<br /><br />2) Jette says her origins are unknown<br /><br />3) According to the 1666 Census Anne Martin was 63 years old. If that was correct, Anne could not have been either Abraham or Marguerites daughter because of the obvious age differential. She could possibly have been a sister or a niece because apparently she was in his household.<br /><br />4) According to most sources, Abraham and Marguerite were married about 1620 and their first son, Eustache was born, 1621. Notwithstanding the above age problems in 1) and 3) above,  it would be unlikely that there would be a spread of 7 years between the first child and the second considering the normal spread of 2 years between births of most FC children of that era.<br /><br />5) Abraham and Marguerites 8th child was named Anne(born 1645). It would be highly unusual for a second child to be have the same name of an older sibling (except, of course the standard  prefix name Marie)unless the first sibling died in infancy. This was not the case because we know that Anne Martin(born 1645) married Jacques Ratte on November 12, 1658 and, of course my Anne Martin married Jean Cote in 1635.<br /><br />So what can we logically conclude from all this?<br /><br />A) I assume the 1666 Census data was obtained from her personally or her family and she would know her own age, and no woman, whether they are French-Canadian, American, ,or any nationality,  would state her age was older than it actually was(1603 vs. 1614) unless that was her correct age. So,  it must be accepted that she was born in 1603 or thereabouts.<br /><br />B) If 1603 was her birthyear, she could not be Abraham and Marguerites daughter and Jette statement that her orgins were unknown must be accepted until some other documentation about her birth come forward. Further, everything else being equal,  most researchers consider Jette to be the more reliable.<br /><br />As I mentioned  before Anne Martin and Jean Cote were my  8th great-grandparents and I would very much like to establish her ancestry but it does not look like her parents were Abraham Martin and Marguerite Langlois based on the above.<br /><br />I am sending this to the general list in case any one out there has other information about her.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><br />Richard L. Dick Boisjolie<br /><a href="mailto:boisjoli@ncn.net">boisjoli@ncn.net</a><br />--------<br />I have a source that might prove useful in considering Anne Martin's<br />birth date. Charbonneau's _Repertoire...du Québec ancien_ volume 1,<br />burials for Notre-Dame-de-Québec states that at the time of Anne<br />Martin's death and burial (4/5 Dec 1684) she was 80 years old. This<br />would support the speculation that Anne was indeed born in 1604.</div>
