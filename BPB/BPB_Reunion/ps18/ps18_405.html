<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for John Stuart</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C9">9</a></span> &#8220;County Tyrone, near Omagh, in Ireland, was the place whence Andrew Stuart and, as it appears from the following references, one brother, if not two, migrated to Pennsylvania and Virginia, in about 1730, because of interference with their religious liberties.&#8221;<br /><br />[Tom Smith, email of 25.5.2001] My notes also have Mary Shaw as dau. of John Shaw of Braid Parish, of<br />Camcastle, Co. Antrim Ire., House of Souchie.  I haven't been able to<br />identify Camcastle or House of Souchie.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1577">1577</a></span> Notes from a report by Margaret Scruggs Carruth written in the 1930's:<br /><br />&quot;Judge John Stuart was our first American Stuart ancestor. He was said to have been most dignified, aristocratic and a stickler for conventionalities, tall and fair with piercing blue eyes and beetling brows. He carried a gold handled cane and wore velvet or satin kneebritches, spotless white shirt, line and lace, and &quot;stocks&quot; and silver shoe buckles, etc., a highly educated, respected, and muchly sought for legal advice. A scion of the 'blood royal,' he was outraged at his only son's marriage to a 'commoner' -- one not in his social circle, yet one from generations of revered, educated ministers of the gospel, who advocated religious freedom zealously.&quot;<br /><br />From an account by Margaret Scruggs Carruth, Dallas, Texas, written in the 1920's, and on file in the Library of Transylvania College, Lexington, Kentucky:<br /><br />&quot;The parents of Capt. John Stuart of Borden's Tract died before the Revolution. John in 1769 and Elizabeth a few years later. He was wonderfully educated and journeyed from place to place in the capacity of a jurist, taking depositions, settling estates, etc. He made several trips back to Ireland and brought back linens, silver, etc. The only son, John born in Ireland in 1740, married in Virginia Elizabeth, daughter of Capt. James Walker of the French and Indian War fame, in Augusta.&quot;<br /><br />Notes from &quot;Representative Women of the South,&quot; by Mrs. Bryan Wells Collier, vol. 3, pp. 101-102:<br /><br />&quot;Capt. John Stuart's home on 'Borden's Tract' is near the present city of Staunton, Virginia. His father, Judge John Stuart, bought the land from Benjamin Borden, Sr. 1740-41, the original purchase being 313 acres, to which other tracts were subsequently added. Here he settled with his wife and only son, John, who was born in Ireland in 1740, and brought to this country an infant in arms. John Stuart, Sr. had a legal education and served as a justice in Augusta County in 1737. His death occurred after a trip back to Ireland to see his relatives in 1769-70. His widow, Elizabeth Archer Stuart, was a sister of John and Sampson Archer who came to Virginia from County Tyrone early in the eighteenth century.&quot;<br /><br /><br />From Emma Siggins White, &quot;Descendants of John Walker of Wigton,&quot; 1902, pp. 51-52:<br /><br />&quot;Of the third brother, John Stuart, we have the following account: Rev. Robert Stuart of Kentucky, in a brief memoir found among his papers after his death, states that his parents came from the north of Ireland, and settled on Walker's Creek, on Borden's tract. Mr. Stuart was born in 1772 and distinctly remembered his grandmother. He does not mention the name of his grandparents. They brought with them to America, an infant son named John. Another son was born, but died young, and there were no other children. We find from old deeds that John received from Joseph Mays a half acre lot in Staunton; this was in 1757. On Sept. 6, 1762, John Stuart and Sarah, his wife, conveyed one-half of the lot to Thomas Lewis, Andrew Lewis and Wm. Preston. Stuart then lived on the other half, as appears from the deed. The part retained was conveyed in 1764 to Israel Christian.<br /><br />In 1765 John Stuart executed to David Stuart a bill of sale for a negro woman and child, and four feather beds. We also find from the same source that John and Robert Stuart were among the early settlers in &quot;Borden's&quot; tract and that their lands were contiguous. Of Robert, no other information. He may have been the father of the John Stuart just mentioned and grandfather of the Rev. Robt. Stuart, but the descendants of the latter think the grandfather's name was John. <br /><br />The John Stuart referred to was a brother of Archibald and David. His permanent home was on Walker's Creek, 6 miles west from Brownsburg. During Indian times his dwelling was fortified to resist attack, and several Lochabar axes and other ancient weapons are still preserved by his descendants. It would seem that feeling insecure on Walker's Creek, he removed to Staunton about 1757 and remained there until 1764, when the Indian wars of that period were over.&quot;<br /><br />From Stewart Clan Magazine, vol. XVII, no. 10, George Edson, editor, p. 148: &quot;John Stewart married Mary _____* in Ireland and came to America &quot;the spring following the winter time of the black frost&quot; [1739-1740] in Ireland. They brought their baby son John, remaining awhile in Pennsylvania and then moving to Virginia. They had another son, born in America, but he died in infancy, and there were no other children.14 In 1742 John bought 313 acres in Augusta county, in the part which was set off as Rockbridge county in 1778, of Benjamin Borden, sr., and this and subsequent purchases were confirmed in 1752 by Benjamin Borden, jr. In December, 1742, John Stuart was among the thirty-odd men in Capt. John McDowell's company who responded to the county lieutenant's, Col. James Patten's, call to repel an Indian raid: the men in this company constituted all the men living in the present Rockbridge county, and 17 were killed fighting Indians at that time. Stewart lived near Lexington, in the neighborhood of Timber Ridge. A deed May 23, 1750, by Benjamin Borden to John Wiley, 280 acres on Kerr's creek, at the corner of Robert McElhenny's land, was delivered to John Stuart in February, 1758. On May 30, 1765, he bought of John Edmiston and wife Margaret 132 acres in Borden's tract, cornering John Stewart and William Edmiston: witnesses to the deed were Samuel Buchanan, William Edmiston and Samuel Edmiston. Aug. 20, 1765, John and Mary deeded to Samuel Steele for £50 148 acres in Borden's tract, corner of Robert Stewart's land: the witnesses were John Stewart, William Edmiston, Samuel Edmiston and John Edmiston. He was free of the county levy in 1768-69, and was therefore presumably 60 years old at that time. He made a visit to Ireland and brought back money and articles he inherited. He died about 1782, and his son John, being his only heir, came into possession of all his property. The &quot;Widow Stuart of Borden's land,&quot; mentioned in 1789 as indebted to the estate of Thomas Stuart, was probably John's widow, for her grandson, Rev. Robert Stuart, born in 1772, had a distinct recollection of her. Only surviving child: John 1740; m. c. 1762, Elizabeth Walker.&quot; *The name of John's wife is known, but we are not at liberty to divulge it and other pertinent facts.</div>
