Lewis Peyton. Published MDCCCLXXXII, on file in Virginia State Library, Richmond, VA, 1952, p. 308.<br /><br />&quot;The Stuarts are of Scotch origin. During the reign of James I they removed to Ireland, where Archibald Stuart married Janet Brown, a sister of Rev. Jno. Brown, the ancestor of the Browns of Rockbridge and Louisiana. In 1727 A. Stuart emigrated to Pennsylvania, after birth of two children, Thomas and Eleanor. In 1738 he removed to Augusta and settled on Pratt's farm, near Waynesboro, where he died 1761. He left issue: 1. Thomas; 2. Eleanor; 3. Alexander; 4. Benjamin; all of whom left large families. Archibald Stuart was joined in Augusta some years after 1738 by two brothers, John and David, who came from Ireland, and both of whom married in Augusta and left descendants, the descendants of the one being the Stuarts of Ohio and Illinois, and of the other, the Stuarts of S.C.&quot;<br /><br />From an account by Margaret Scruggs Carruth, Dallas, Texas, written in the 1920's, and on file in the Library of Transylvania College, Lexington, Kentucky:<br /><br />&quot;Early in the 18th century, due to his religious views (being a Presbyterian), Archibald Stuart was forced by the Catholics to flee for his life, living incognito for about seven years in Pennsylvania. Then when amnesty was declared he sent for his wife, Janet Brown and their two children, Thomas and Eleanor, being brought over by his brother Andrew, whose wife Mary, daughter of Lord Dinwiddie, and whose infant son John later bacame the missionary to the Canadian Indians, near Kingston, Canada, from whom the celebrated Justice of Lower Canada, Knights, - represented today by Sir Campbell Stuart, manager of the London Times. Andrew and his family settled at Paxtang, Pa., but Archibald and his family - from whom the celebrated Col. J.E.B. Stuart, the dashing cavalry cavalier descended - went into Virginia when Augusta County was opened up by Benjamin Border, Sr., and was joined there by two younger brothers, John and his wife, Elizabeth, sister of John and Sampson Archer from Tyrone, Ireland, with their infant son, John; and later by David, who married there in Augusta to Margaret Jane Lynn, widow of Paul (Pall). David's only son, John was called 'Capt. John Stuart of Greenbrier,' during the Revolutionary War to distinguish him from his first cousin, 'Capt. John Stuart of Borden's Tract,' son of John and Elizabeth Archer Stuart, about the same age and both officers.<br /><br />The parents of Capt. John Stuart of Borden's Tract died before the Revolution. John in 1769 and Elizabeth a few years later. He was wonderfully educated and journeyed from place to place in the capacity of a jurist, taking depositions, settling estates, etc. He made several trips back to Ireland and brought back linens, silver, etc. The only son, John born in Ireland in 1740, married in Virginia Elizabeth, daughter of Capt. James Walker of the French and Indian War fame, in Augusta.<br /><br />From Joseph Waddell, &quot;Annals of Augusta County, 1726 to 1876,&quot; Staunton, VA, 1902, p. 367 [Virginia Genealogies, FTM CD#205, Disk 2] : &quot;Archibald Stuart (b.abt1700,d.1759) &quot;born in Londonderry abt. 1700. About the year 1725 he was obliged to leave England with others on account of promoting an armed insurrection to defend their religious rights. He managed with great difficulty to escape and leaving his wife and two children behind, fled to America and lived in Western Pennsylvania. He remained in seclusion for seven years living under an assumed name. An act of amnesty was passed and he sent for his family. They came in 1732 with his wife's brother, John Brown. He removed with his family to Augusta County, VA about 1738, settling near what is now the town of Waynesboro. Two brothers John and David came from Ireland and joined him in Augusta County some years later. He died in 1759.&quot; <br /><br /><br />From &quot;Chalkley's Chronicles of the Scotch-Irish in Virginia&quot; ABSTRACTS OF WILLS OF AUGUSTA COUNTY, VIRGINIA. AUGUSTA COUNTY COURT. WILL BOOK No. 3.

Proved, 17th November, 1761, by Jno. and Andrew Campbell. Executors qualified, with Jno. Campbell. Andrew Campbell.<br /><br />From &quot;A History of Rockbridge County, Virginia&quot; by Oren F. Morton, published in 1920: Archibald Stuart left Ulster in 1731, and came to the Borden Tract in 1738, an amnesty having permitted him to send for his family. His wife, Janet, was a sister to the Reverend John Brown. Two sons were Thomas and Alexander, the latter born in 1735. Alexander was very tall and strong and wielded a ponderous broadsword in the battle of Guilford, where he was wounded and taken prisoner. His son Archibald, who died in 1831 at the age of seventy-four, removed to Staunton in 1785. He was the father of Alexander H. H. Stuart, Secretary of the Interior in the Cabinet of President Fillmore. Robert Stuart of Rockbridge and Judge Alexander Stuart of Missouri were brothers to Archibald, a grandson of whom was the dashing Confederate cavalry leader, General J. E. B. Stuart.<br /><br />From &quot;Tinkling Spring: Headwater of Freedom, A Study of the Church and Her People 1732-1952&quot; by Howard McKnight Wilson, The Tinkling Spring and Hermitage Presbyterian Churches, Fisherville, VA, 1952, pp. 31-32: &quot;The direct heritage of the Valley pioneers of faith -- and they were not all Presbyterian faithfuls, for many sought adventure or land or fortune or license, instead of liberty -- can be traced to the Scotch immigrants who helped defend Londonderry, Ireland against the Papists' army [1688]. . . . Though the Presbyterian defenders outnumbered the Episcopalians fifteen to one, and by their great sacrifice and bravery secured the kingdom to the Protestant Prince of Orange, they had less than any reward in after years, being compelled to pay their tithes to support an established church, while maintaining their Presbyterian ministers and church separately, and suffering the civil disabilities associated with Establishment. One of the 'apprentice boys' who shut the gates of Londonderry was named Stewart. We select for illustration the family tradition of a Tinkling Spring family by the same name, though there are others with the same heritage among them. Archibald Stuart (often spelled Stewart) was a Presbyterian immigrant to Augusta County in 1738. His was a Scotch family of Londonderry background. He was born about 1700. When of age he married Miss Janet Brown; some give the date as 1722. The best information available indicates that he was engaged in an insurrection against the government in defense of his religious rights and was forced to flee to America about 1725, leaving his family behind. After seven years of living quietly and alone in Pennsylvania, he was released from the danger of arrest by a general amnesty in 1732; then he sent for his family, which consisted of his wife Janet, a son Thomas, a daughter Eleanor, and Mrs. Stuart's young brother John Brown, who at the time was only about four years of age. The family, destined to become distinguished in both state and church affairs, joined the effort to establish a place of worship -- later to become Tinkling Spring Presbyterian Church. <br /><br />This story of the Stuart family's struggle for faith and liberty tells of but one of the seventy families that joined together to establish a place of worship at Tinkling Spring.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Source: Virginia G. Pedigo and Lewis G. Pedigo, &quot;History of Patrick and Henry Counties, Virginia&quot; 1933 pages: 263-264 &quot;The Stuart Family of Virginia Archibald Stuart, a man of substance and a Presbyterian of the great clan in the lowlands of Scotland, landed in Pennsylvania, in 1746. The mercurial and stubborn Stuart blood having involved him in the political troubles of the period. Avoiding Scotland, he had refugeed briefly in Londonderry, Ireland, and thence come with many others to Pennsylvania, where he lived obscurely for seven years. After that things were calmer and he was able to send back for his family, but the Stuarts in common with numerous families of Scotch-Irishry found neither Pennsylvania nor its placid citizens congenial. The Scotch- Irish are a clannish lot and live by preference in the shadow of the hills with a line of retreat always open. There was a steady draft of them from Pennsylvania, south, across the Potomac and up the valley of the Shenandoah, and in 1738, Archibald Stuart established his family in what is now Augusta County, Virginia. He reared four children and acquired large lands. His second son was Alexander Stuart, who came to manhood with the Revolutionary War, and was Major in Colonel Samuel McDowell's regiment at the battle of Guilford Court House. He commanded the regiment, had two horses killed under him and took a heavy wound. He was captured and was admired of his enemies, for when he was exchanged, the British returned his sword to him and it is treasured in the family to this day with certain other blades that are bright with honor. Major Stuart was an able man. He advanced the fortunes of his family took a leading part in the affairs of his generation. He was one of the founders of the Washington and Lee. He lived ninety years. The youngest son of Major Stuart, called Alexander after him, was the first Stuart to see the West and to serve the Federal Government. He was United States Judge in Illinois and in Missouri, Speaker of the Missouri Legislature and member of the Executive Council in Virginia. He died in 1832, full of honors. Archibald Stuart, his eldest son, served in he army in the War of 1812, and followed the profession of law. He went to the Virginia Legislature from Campbell County, and later from Patrick. He was heard in the Constitutional Convention of 1829 and 1830, and represented the Patrick District in Federal Congress. His portrait shows a handsome face, high-bred, genial and ruddy with bright eyes and certain weakness about the mouth. He was a notable orator, famous on the hustings, admired in legislative halls and exceedingly convivial.&quot;<br /><br /><i>	•	From:</i> &quot;Nettie S.
