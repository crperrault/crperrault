<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Robert Dinwiddie</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Lt-Governor of Virginia<br /><br />C119434<br /><br />[Practical Reference Library] &quot;Dinwiddie, Robert (1690-1770), a <br />colonial official in America, born in Scotland.  He was governor of <br />Virginia from 1752 to 1758, but was recalled, after precipitating the <br />French and Indian War and, by his ill temper, avarice and <br />incompetence, rendering himself generally unbearable to the <br />Americans.&quot;<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C9">9</a></span> b. at Germistown 1693<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C875">875</a></span> Robert Dinwiddie was sent to the New World in 1727 as a collector of customs in Bermuda, where his ability and integrity resulted in promotion.  In 1751 he was appointed Lt. Gov of Virginia, which post he held until 1757 after he had requested recall because of ill-health.  He died in England in 1770.  He left no family in America and no descendants named Dinwiddie.  His wife and two daughters returned to England with him.  One daughter died unmarried;  the other Rebecca, married a Manxman who did not emigrate.  <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C881">881</a></span> Lt. Governor Robert Dinwiddie<br /><br />Robert Dinwiddie was born of an old Scottish family. His father was a prosperous merchant, and his mother also came from a commercial family. Robert was educated at the University of Glasgow and entered his father's countinghouse. He later carried on a successful career as a merchant.<br /><br />Dinwiddie's role as a colonial administrator began in 1721, when he was appointed British representative in Bermuda. After 16 years of service in Bermuda, he received the important position of surveyor general, which included jurisdiction over Pennsylvania and the southern colonies of British North America. By tradition the surveyor general was entitled to a seat on the Virginia Council, a post Dinwiddie insisted on assuming. Characteristic of Dinwiddie's service in the Colonies was his zealous attention to the offices under his authority and a tendency to maximize his position by emphasizing the royal prerogative. In recognition of these qualities, he was appointed lieutenant governor of Virginia, England's largest colony, and took office on July 4, 1751. <br /><br />As lieutenant governor, Dinwiddie saw the beginnings of the conflict on Virginia's frontier that led to the French and Indian War. He was a firm advocate of British expansion into the west. He sought the help of the Indians and the other British colonies in the struggle against the French, pressed the legislature for defense funds, and favored the use of regular armed forces in place of the less reliable militia. Dinwiddie made George Washington a lieutenant colonel in 1754. <br /><br />Generally, Dinwiddie was able to work in harmony with the Virginia Legislature. He did, however, prompt a serious conflict with the House of Burgess shortly after he took office. In hope of increasing the British King's revenues, Dinwiddie tried to levy a fee for land patents, which would also require landholders to pay quitrents to the Crown. This precipitated the famous &quot;Pistole Fee&quot; controversy, in which the lower house charged that the governor had imposed an unlawful tax that endangered colonial liberty-a precursor of the arguments of the American Revolution. <br /><br />The pressures of office and the war badly taxed Dinwiddie's health. At his own request he was relieved of office in 1758, and with his wife and two daughter's returned to Britain. He died in London on July 27, 1770.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C882">882</a></span> Robert Dinwiddie, Lieutenant Governor of the Virginia Colony from 1751 to 1758, was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on October 3, 1692. Educated at the University of Glasgow, he graduated in 1710 or 1711. Although the years following his graduation are undocumented, it is assumed that he entered a trade, probably in the counting house of his father. By the age of 30, Dinwiddie had become a successful trader and one of the richest men in St. George's Parish, Bermuda. In 1738 Horatio Walpole (brother of Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole) appointed Dinwiddie as Surveyor General of the Southern Part of the Continent of North America, making him the overseer of customs services in South and North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, the Bahama Islands, and Jamaica. He was also a member of the Council of Bermuda.<br /><br />As Surveyor General, Dinwiddie was required to reside within the district he oversaw. In June 1741, Dinwiddie arrived in Virginia, taking up residence near Norfolk, where he and his family remained until 1746. In that year Dinwiddie consigned the Surveyor General post to Peter Randolph of Virginia and returned to London, where he invested in the shipping business. During these years Dinwiddie won the good will of John Carteret, Earl of Granville, and George Dunk, Earl of Halifax.<br /><br />These gentlemen, as well as Horatio Walpole, were influential in obtaining Dinwiddie's appointment as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia on July 4, 1751. Although he performed the duties of governor and coveted the title, Dinwiddie was never titular governor of Virginia. William Anne Keppel, Earl of Albemarle, held the title and shared the salary assigned to the governor's position.<br /><br />During the seven years of Dinwiddie's term he was a staunch advocate of the authority of Great Britain over the colonies. He has been called the &quot;Grandfather of the American Revolution&quot; because of his patronage of George Washington, but he was not and never became a supporter of colonial rights. In fact his pistole tax, which colonists were required to pay to the Governor each time his seal was affixed to a document, was a source of great dissension in Virginia.<br /><br />Dinwiddie was indirectly involved in the initiation of the Seven Years War, because of his direct participation in the French and Indian War in the colonies. Although France and England would not make formal declaration of war until May, 1756, the conflict began in the colonies in 1753. Following reports of French establishment of forts on the Ohio River, Lt. Governor Dinwiddie dispatched Virginia Militia Major George Washington to assert British sovereignty over that territory and to demand immediate French withdrawal. The French refused and Dinwiddie sent Colonel Trent to build and defend a fort at a strategic position on the Ohio River. The fort was later named Fort Necessity.<br /><br />On May 28, 1754, Washington, who had been dispatched to reinforce Fort Necessity, attacked and defeated a French detachment lead by Ensign Joseph Coulon, sieur de Jumonville. Outraged, the French responded by attacking and forcing Washington's surrender of the fort on July 3, 1754. The war escalated in the colonies in 1755, with the French dominating. The French defeat of General Edward Braddock and his regiments of British regulars at the Monongahela River on July 7, 1755, was a tremendous blow to the colonies and to Robert Dinwiddie.<br /><br />In March 1756, the Earl of Loudoun was appointed the Governor of Virginia and Commander-in-Chief of all North American military forces. By the fall of 1757, Robert Dinwiddie and his family left Virginia for England, where he resided for the remainder of his life. In poor health, Dinwiddie made frequent visits to Bath for therapeutic treatments. On July 27, 1770, Robert Dinwiddie died at Clifton, near Bath.<br /><br />Sources:<br /><br />Alden, John Richard.

The Dinwiddies lived at Dumfries before they settled at Glasgow but it is apparent that the future governor was not born a country gentleman.  Undoubtedly brought up a Presbyterian;  it is not clear whether he became an Anglican as a consequence of his marriage, although he was later in life a champion, if not a communicant, of the Church of England.</div>
