<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for William Frederick (Manny) Davidson</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Birth and baptism from Methodist Church records<br /><br />Is 20 and a clerk  in 1871 Census. Never married.<br /><br />[ SD] I found a<br />book at the library today called &quot;Thunder Bay District 1821-1892&quot;. I<br />think it's part of a series on Ontario. There are three references to <br />Wm<br />F Davidson. One refers to a company called &quot;Elevator 'A', Shuniah <br />Dock<br />and Forwarding Co. Ltd., a company organized in 1882 of which he was<br />vice-president. In a footnote it says he had moved to the Landing in<br />1870 and had soon become local manager for steamship lines, first the<br />Collingwood Line, then the Beatty Sarnia Line. The second reference <br />is<br />to a dock built into the bay and says &quot;management of the dock is<br />attended to by Mr. F. Davidson, agent for the North-West <br />Transportation<br />Company&quot;. The footnote says W.F. Davidson presumably planned to make <br />use<br />of the Lake Superior dock only until the new dock was constructed for<br />the Elevator 'A'... Company of which he was vice-president. The third<br />reference is to the inauguration (their term) of the beginning of the<br />railway construction in T.B. It gives a list of those present. <br />Included<br />are Wm. F. Davidson and...Mr. &amp; Mrs T.A.P. Towers (would you believe<br />Ellen and her husband). This is from an article in the Toronto Globe<br />June 10, 1875.<br /><br />Could be the William Davidson from the 1881 Census in Port Arthur, <br />Ont., male, 29, born in Québec, CofE, Scottish origin, occupation: <br />Agent.<br /><br />&gt;From the Montréal Daily Star Friday August 21, 1891<br />DAVIDSON at Toronto, on 18th August, of rheumatism, William Frederick<br />Davidson, eldest son of John Davidson, 9 Bishop St., Montréal. <br />Funeral<br />private. (Port Arthur and Sault Ste Marie papers please copy)<br />-------------------<br />Email by Brent Scollie &lt;<a href="mailto:fbrent@attcanada.net">fbrent@attcanada.net</a>&gt; to Sally Davidson on<br />Sun, 09 May 1999<br /><br />My query was posted on County of Huntingdon Quebec rootsweb. My<br />interest is in William Frederick Davidson b. 1851? probably Montreal,<br />eldest son of John Davidson and Margaret Hingston d. 8 August 1891<br />Toronto ON age 40. Buried Mount Royal Cemetery, Montreal QU Section<br />G850.  His grandfather Colonel John Davidson immigrated to Lower<br />Canada about 1820. His father John Davidson (1812?-1899) served as a<br />captain in the militia regiment raised by Colonel Davidson for the<br />Huntingdon District and passed his enthusiasm for military life to his<br />son. In 1846 he married Margaret Hingston (1827-1909), the sister of<br />Sir William Hales Hingston (1829-1907), Montreal physician and mayor.<br />For some years he was store keeper at the Bruce Mines and later Silver<br />Islet for the Montreal Mining Co. During this lengthy period in the<br />Algoma region, some of his children took root there. His daughter<br />Ellen married Algoma pioneer T.A.P. Towers (q.v.) who lived in Thunder<br />Bay 1870-78. His son William was one of the earliest to arrive in PAL,<br />possibly 1870/71 when he worked for Thomas Marks in his general store.<br />In 1871 he was connected with the 3A Mining Company. In 1872 he took<br />charge of local business for the Collingwood line of steamers where he<br />remained 5 years before accepting a similar position with the North<br />West Transportation Co. (Beatty's Sarnia line) in June 1878. Davidson<br />was first elected to Shuniah council at a by-election 23 August 1879.<br />He served as reeve of Shuniah after PA's withdrawal in 1884. In 1882<br />he acted as local agent for American H.P. Weiland's lumber yard,<br />corner Cameron and Water Streets. By June 1884 he was PA harbour<br />master and appointed by the Macdonald government in 1885 to be one of<br />three local Dominion liquor commissioners, when the Federal government<br />unsuccessfully challenged Ontario's jurisdiction in this area. He was<br />partner in a firm which contracted to handle CPR freight arriving at<br />the Government Dock during the 1885 shipping season when about 40<br />freighthandlers struck, fearing the firm had bid too low to pay their<br />wages. Davidson visited his parents in Montreal at the beginning of<br />1887, was re-elected chief of PA fire brigade in March and, as color<br />sergeant of the Algoma Rifles, attended the spring militia school. He<br />was already reported to be suffering from &quot;an attack of inflammatory<br />rheumatism&quot;. In April 1888, for unknown reasons, John Hancock and W.J.<br />Inglis (q.v.) took over the Beatty shipping agency. His brother James<br />A. (Jack) Davidson, a consumptive, died at PA 30 Dec 1888. Davidson<br />drops from view after this sad event. At the time of his death from<br />rheumatism in Toronto, his parents were living in Montreal at 9 Bishop<br />St. The Herald referred to him as &quot;a jolly comrade and good<br />neighbour&quot;. Another brother, John Grant Davidson, said to be the<br />second son, died at his father's residence 9 Bishop Street 11 Sept<br />1895 age 32.<br /> Affiliations: Presbyterian but attended Anglican church, Conservative<br /><br /><br />I am also interested in Ellen Davidson who married T.A.P. Towers of<br />Sault Ste Marie. I have amassed quite a bit of material on W.F.<br />Davidson for a biographical dictionary I am writing on the mayors and<br />councillors of Thunder Bay 1873-1945. Davidson was a Shuniah<br />councillor in the 1870s, Shuniah was a predecessor municipal<br />corporation of Port Arthur ON. You might also be interested to know<br />that CBC announcer Lorne Saxberg desperately needs information on the<br />Davidson family as there is a connection with the Silver Islet Mine<br />store which is being restored by his family. The back page of the OHS<br />Bulletin (Ontario Historical Society) recently was devoted to a query<br />of his asking for help on the Davidson family.
