<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1885">1885</a></span> [sep] died of suffocation in the burning of the Hochelaga Commission School , aged 6 years<br /><br />From: &quot;Pennie Redmile&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:predmile@total.net">predmile@total.net</a>&gt;<br />Subject: [MONTREAL] Hochelaga School fire<br />Date: Fri, 31 Aug 2001 10:57:58 -0400<br /><br />Hello fellow Montreal listers,<br /><br />This story about the fire in East End Montreal in 1907 was the worst known<br />disaster - to date - involving children.<br /><br />The fire apparently broke out just before 2pm &amp; by 3pm the bravery of some -<br />had resulted in most of the children being saved.. but tragically - 16<br />children &amp; their beloved principal Miss Sarah Maxwell - perished - leaving<br />Montreal just reeling from shock.<br /><br />It was a 4 story building &amp; the older children were on the bottom floors &amp;<br />the younger children were on the upper floors. The newspaper gives<br />conflicting renditions.. but it seems that there was smoke &amp; that wasn't<br />unusual as they had a faulty furnace. By the time anyone realized the<br />danger, it was too late to get the children out.. as the stairwells were<br />full of thick smoke. Miss Maxwell &amp; the teachers herded the children back<br />to the safety (??) of the upper room. Meanwhile there was an ice house<br />almost directly across the st..&amp; the workers there saw the flames &amp; ran to<br />find ladders - to reach the upper window/s. Not enough ladders were found..<br />but of the ones that were, the men were able to save many children, thanks<br />to the fact that Miss Maxwell &amp; the teachers..were lifting the children (6-8<br />yrs olds) out the windows to the men. Though relatively young, this was an<br />enormous feat on the part of these women as the children must have been<br />heavy . One story says the fire dept only saved 2 children.. (didn't get<br />there in time) &amp; almost saved Miss Maxwell..but an explosion prevented that.<br />Another story says Miss Maxwell just collapsed from fatique. At least 50<br />children were saved. -- The confusion that followed was &quot;unreal&quot; - as<br />desperate parents arrived on the scene searching for their loved ones. Many<br />had been taken to homes nearby.. &amp; the bodies had been taken to the morgue.<br />The newspaper had full coverage of the anguish (&amp; in some cases relief) of<br />the parents who feared the worst..&amp; later found their children alive. The<br />inconsolation of the parents who lost children is difficult to read. -<br /><br />Then followed a campaign (seems to have been the brainchild of the Montreal<br />Star - but I've only looked at that newpaper.) They asked children to send<br />in their donations for a fitting &quot;memorial&quot; to Miss Maxwell. I've found 13<br />&quot;instalments&quot; so far.. &amp; this certainly will interest all of you who had<br />family in Montreal at the time... but I can't possibly type up all these<br />names. The idea was (&amp; here's where we come in) to help future Montrealers<br />know the bravery of this one lady by making a &quot;memorial&quot; to her memory that<br />no one could forget. -<br /><br />There's reams of info..on this story &amp; these subscriptions from children<br />read like this (all are published) : (few chosen at random)<br /><br />1. Master Kenneth Carter 4094 Tupper St sends 25 for the Maxwell<br />Memorial fund<br /><br />2. Please accept $1. for the Maxwell Fund on behalf of my little boy<br />George Haslam - Lachine<br /><br />3. After reading last night's paper , mamma said I should give<br />something from my savings bank for the memorial for Miss Maxwell. Here<br />is 25. Gilbert MacLeay - Richmond Quebec.<br /><br />4. Fred Beaumont sends 15 to the Maxwell Memorial Fund<br /><br />5. Enclosed find 50 , our little mite for Miss Maxwell 's fund, hoping it<br />will help to do somethingthat can always be pointed out as a mark of respect<br />to one of the world's greatest heroines. Nelly &amp; Arthur Wilden<br /><br />6. We enclose $1. towards the memorial for Miss Maxwell &amp; hope her dear<br />Mother will not be forgotton - Jane &amp; Annie Pounden (nb: Miss Maxwell lived<br />with her widowed mother - &amp; it was decided to give her Miss Maxwell's full<br />salary for the rest of the yr..&amp; then someone else offered to put up a $500.<br />annuity for Mrs Maxwell.)<br /><br />7. I would like Miss Maxwell's photo and I am one of her little pupils. I<br />send 25 an d I am sorry to lose her. She was a kind teacher to us all.<br />Fanny Pickles - aged 10. (nb; the Mtl Star sent out free photos of Miss<br />Maxwell to the first 1000 who sent money )<br /><br />The sums of money sent in - given how little money children had in 1907 is<br />very impressive.<br /><br />I think this is too long - so will write out the list of dead - in another<br />e-mail.<br /><br />Pennie<br /><br /><br />From: &quot;Pennie Redmile&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:predmile@total.net">predmile@total.net</a>&gt;<br />Subject: [MONTREAL] Hochelaga school fire - victims<br />Date: Fri, 31 Aug 2001 11:36:12 -0400<br /><br />The names of the victims of the fire are:<br /><br />Maxwell, Sarah school principal - aged 31 (lived 479A St Urbain St with<br />her mother)<br /><br />Zimmerman, Wm John aged 7 , only child of W Zimmerman of 411 Alwin St -<br />identified by father.<br /><br />Lindley, James Pilkington aged 6, 119 Alwin St, identified by father James<br />Pilkington Lindley<br /><br />Jackson, Albert Edward aged 6 of 22 Wurtele St - son of John H Jackson<br /><br />Golson, Edith - aged 6 yrs &amp; 8 months, 311 Stradacona St, dau/o John Golson.<br /><br />Rich, Lillian - aged 5 - 28 Marl borough St, dau/ Harrison Rich, identified<br />by Thomas Williams.<br /><br />Davey, Edna aged 5 yrs, 14 Marlborough St, dau/ John Davey<br /><br />Lampton, Ethel aged 5 yrs - dau/ George Lambton<br /><br />McPherson, James - aged 7, 333 Prefontaine St - son/ James McPherson (nb:<br />the school was on Prefontaine St)<br /><br />Andrew, Annie Jackson - aged 8 - dau/ Henry Jackson Andrew 63 Cuvillier St<br /><br />Forbes, Cecilia - aged 6 - 59 Cuvillier St - dau/ Thomas Forbes<br /><br />Lomas, John - aged 6 - s/o George Lomas - 111 Davidson St<br /><br />Anderson, James Frederick aged 6 - 94 St Germain St - only child of JF<br />Anderson<br /><br />Spragge, Myrtle aged 8 - &amp; - Mabel aged 3 daus/o A Spragge, builder,<br />1726 St Catherine St East<br /><br />Johnson, Joseph - aged 7 - 424 Cuvillier St - younger s/o Thomas Johnson<br /><br />Hingston, Gladys -aged 6 - dau/ Wm Hingston - 57a Rouville St</div>
