<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for William Mittleberger</div>

<div class="psNotesData">[bap] Parents John M Sr and Ann (with mark).  Witnesses Soln amd Elizabeth M.<br /><br />Probably the William Mittleberger who emigrated to Cleveland<br /><br />THere were Henry, Charles and  William M in Cleveland fl 1840-60<br /><br /><a href="http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Pinzone%20Sharon%20Morrison.pdf?acc_num=csu1248799957">http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Pinzone%20Sha...cc_num=csu1248799957</a><br />William Mittleberger was born in Montreal, Canada in 1803, and at age 15 began serving a seven-year apprenticeship as a bookkeeper with the North West Fur Company, a competitor of the Hudson Bay Company. His work took him all over the hunting grounds of British America until he returned to Montreal in 1825, accepting a contract to build a portion of the Rideau Canal and later, the Welland Canal near Oneida County in New York. He arrived midway (1840) in what was called Cleveland&#8217;s &#8220;canal period&#8221; (1830-1850) at age 37, before the advent of Cleveland&#8217;s railroads.1	Because of his canal experiences, he well knew the opportunity for commercial trade when the Ohio Canal opened Cleveland to the Ohio interior in 1827—the canal period was a crucial mercantile development for the city. In its early years from its founding in 1796 through the 1820s Cleveland had struggled with unhealthy conditions from swampy areas, its remoteness and lack of access roads, fear of British ships during the 1812 war, and what might even be called its lack of purpose. Though it was surveyed in 1796 similar to a New England village, the few who came and stayed (only 150 people and 34 houses, mostly log, by 1820) had barely cleared the stumps of what was essentially a two-street town (Superior and Water), surrounded by forest and standing oak posts marking the 222 lots laid out in the original survey. Cleveland proper actually sat on a plateau bordered east and west by rivers and valleys, not easily accessible until the canal and railroads linked the town to<br />70the water. Cleveland remained a pioneer settlement until the 1815-1830 period when stage roads (i.e. Pittsburgh and Buffalo Roads) connected Cleveland to trade route populations. Better tools, construction of bridges, the first steamboat in 1818, the clearing of sandbars and debris from the Cuyahoga River in 1825, and the opening of the Ohio Canal to its Cleveland terminus in 1827—all expanded the &#8220;village&#8221; and drew the interest of wholesalers, building trades, small retailers, lawyers, bankers, real estate speculators and developers. Mittleberger joined his brother Charles to become a well- liked, successful coal and produce merchant who would in the late 1860s be named to the Cleveland Board of Trade. 2<br />Searching the Cleveland directories of the time (independently published) one can trace William Mittleberger through a series of work addresses close to the Cuyahoga River. Elijah Peet published his first Cleveland directory in 1845, and lists Mittleberger&#8217;s workplace as 88 and 85 Merwin Street from 1845-1847, and his residence as &#8220;3 Erie Street South&#8221; those three years. He was referred to as a &#8220;commercial merchant.&#8221; Both his advertising and his directory listings for years referred to his business address as &#8220;Stockly&#8217;s Pier,&#8221; which was built by John Galt Stockly, a well-known coal merchant, and former Philadelphia shipyard owner from an old Virginia family, who had come to Cleveland in 1838 by way of two years in Canada. He also had worked on the Canadian Welland Canal, and may well have known Mittleberger beforehand.3<br />There was a &#8220;Mittleberger Warehouse&#8221; on Superior about where the Huntington and Fifth Third Bank parking garages stand today, and diagonally south of where the Cleveland Public Library is located near West 6th. Old City Hall and public office buildings occupied that space across from the Mittleberger Warehouse in those early<br />71<br />days. Henry and Charles Mittleberger, and William, associated with that warehouse, are mentioned in advertisements and editorials in the 1840s and 1850s. Charles and wife Julia are buried in the Mittleberger plot in Lakeview Cemetery—their bodies, and the bodies of Augusta&#8217;s younger brothers who died young, and her father William were all moved from Woodland Cemetery when Augusta buried her mother in 1882 and reinterred the whole family in Lakeview Cemetery in 1883.<b>4<br /></b>Though Mittleberger is listed as a &#8220;coal merchant&#8221; in city directories and advertising from 1840, references to William Mittleberger recur in the local papers throughout his years in Cleveland, as he frequently advertised, and spoke his mind on local business issues, some examples of which follow: In a May, 1846 letter to the editor, Mittleberger and Virgil Hillyer warned the people of Cleveland and Buffalo against taking passage on the steamboat Oregon, &#8220;as passengers cannot rely upon their engagement&#8221;. Apparently on a Buffalo to Cleveland trip of only 8-10 passengers, the ship&#8217;s officers would not let Mittleberger and Hillyer off the boat at Cleveland, but passed on to Detroit and detained the unhappy travelers for 24 hours.	Mittleberger suspected the Oregon was trying to make Chicago before another ship, the Empire. The issue sparked responses back and forth.5	An 1858 notice reads &#8220;William Mittleberger, coal agent on Stockly Pier, offers to sell good strip vein coal for $2.75 per ton.&#8221; In 1868, Mittleberger was listed as a member of the Cleveland Board of Trade, a commercially and politically influential entity that would later become the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce.6<br />The coal piers lined the east bank of the mouth of the Cuyahoga River; Stockly&#8217;s</div>
