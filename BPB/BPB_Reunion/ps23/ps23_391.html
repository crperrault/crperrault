<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Charles &#8220;Carlos&#8221; Alexis Hypolite Beaubien</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1636">1636</a></span> In 1844 he owned the Sangre de Cristo ranch in Taos, New Mexico, of one million acres, which he sold just before his death to Gov.Gilpin.  He was known as Don Carlos.  <br /><br />[Murphy] <span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1634">1634</a></span>  He was baptised as Alexis Hypolite.  He studied classics at the seminaire de Nicolet and studied for the priesthood at the séminaire de Québec.   He soon realized that he could never fully devote himself to the work of the Church.  In desperation, he fled Canada in 1821, ashamed of his failure to fulfill parental expectations.  In St. Louis he joined a party of trappers and traders bound for the Indian Country.  There he was apparently employed by the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Co, for which he was trading when a party became lost and accidentally entered New Mexico about 1823.  The men were arrested and hauled to Mexico City.  In the capital, the officials suddenly changed their tune and apologized for the unfriendly reception, even allowing the foreigners to remain n New Mexico if they wished.  <br /><br />Beaubien returned to Taos and opened a store to supply trappers and traders who frequented the upper Rio Grande.  In 1829, he applied for naturalization as a Mexican citizen, which was granted to him 30.11.1829, along with Gervais Nolan, John Rowland, Antoine and Louis Robidoux.  <br /><br />His store did well and he became one of the wealthiest citizens of the thriving community of Taos.  He began to assume an important role as one of the leaders of the non-Mexican residents of the area.   He often found himself in opposition to Father Martinez, the curate of Taos, who was extremely suspicious of foreigners, directing much of his antipathy towards Beaubien and the American Charles Bent.  In 1840, all natural born citizens were exempted from paying taxes, placing the burden of taxation on foreigners.  <br /><br />Beaubien wished to acquire a ranch on the eastern side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, along the Santa Fe trail and far from Father Martinez.  He knew, however, that Gov. Manuel Armijo would never grant such a tract to anyone of foreign birth.  He thus invited Don Guadalupe Miranda, Secretary of Government at Santa Fe, to join him in the venture.  Beaubien and Miranda&#8217;s petition for over one million acres of land was approved on 11.1.1841 but an incursion by Texas soldiers delayed their occupation of the land till 12.2.1843.  To facilitate development of the land, they granted quarter interests to Amijo and to Charles Bent, an American entrepreneur.  As expected, Father Martinez objected to the grant, and with the demise of Amijo, the grant was suspended on 27.2.1844.  Beaubien replied to Fr. Martinez&#8217;s charges and the suspension was revoked in April 1844.  Development began along the Põnil and Cimarron rivers, near the present town of Cimarron.  The first two settlers were Kit Carson, already famous for his service as a guide to John C. Frémont first expedition west, and Richard Owens, who would make his fame on Frémont&#8217;s third expedition [and after whom the Owens Valley in California is named].  <br /><br />In June 1846, General Stephen Watts Kearny  invaded New Mexico and established a government in September.  Charles Bent was named governor and Beaubien one of the three judges of the territorial supreme court.  <br /><br />The American takeover of New Mexico caused great changes for the owners of the Beaubien-Miranda grant.  Beaubien and Bent would have to play major political roles and Armijo and Miranda, who had fled south before the invading army, would want payment for their share.  There was also the question of how the claimants would fare under American law.<br /><br />In December 1846, Beaubien, Bent, Armijo and Miranda agreed to sell their interest in the grant for $4,000, keeping only 30,000 acres along the Rayado river.  However, final payment was never made and the transfer did not happen.<br /><br />There continued to be unrest in the area.  A plot to overthrow the government in Santa Fe was uncovered in late December 1846.  Father Martinez continued to lead the Mexicans in Taos.  Three of the leading citizens of Taos, Sheriff Stephen Lee, James Leal and Cornelio Vigil, who had supervised the settlement of the Cimarron area, went town to Santa Fe to confer with Gov. Bent about the Taos situation.  Bent decided to visit Taos himself to quiet tempers.  Disregarding pleas that he wait for a military escort, he and his party, including Beaubien&#8217;s son Narciso,  left Santa Fe on 14.1.1847.  <br /><br />Narciso had been away for five years at Cape Girardeau College in Missouri from which he had recently graduated.  Bright, proficient in English, French and Spanish, he seemed ready to step in his father&#8217;s place as a leader of New Mexican affairs.  late in 1843, Narciso and Stephen Louis had been given a ranch of their own, the one-million acre Sangre de Cristo grant in southern Colorado, by Gov. Amijo.  <br /><br />Arriving in Taos after four days&#8217; travel, Bent promised the Pueblos a fair hearing.  But gunfire erupted that night and a mob marched through Taos.  Lee was dragged from his bed and hacked to pieces.  Vigil, who tried to rescue him, was similarly murdered.  Leal was stripped naked and scalped alive.  Narciso Beaubien and a friend hid under a haystack but were discovered, killed, and scalped.  The mob finally found Bent and killed and scalped him also. <br /><br />Fortunately, Carlos Beaubien was holding court at Tierra Amarilla at the time of the uprising.  In January 1847, a new group of men took over the direction of the Beaubien-Miranda grant.  Lucien B. Maxwell and Jesus G. Abreu, sons-in-law of Beaubien, trekked across the mountains to the Rayado River where they again attempted to establish a permanent settlement.  The population of the grant rapidly increased.  By the time he died in 1864, Charles Hypolite Beaubien had finally succeeded in taming New Mexico&#8217;s eastern frontier.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1635">1635</a></span> [Beaubien petition for citizenship] He gives his place of birth as Nicolet and says that he left Canada in 1821 and reached New Mexico two years later.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1640">1640</a></span> Set against the grandeur of the northern New Mexico landscape, Grant of Kingdom, published in 1950, is perhaps Fergusson's best novel; it is, in addition, one of the great novels of western<br />American literature. The story is based on the history of the Maxwell Land Grant, an enormous tract of nearly two million acres centering on the town of Cimarron, New Mexico. Ceded to Carlos<br />Beaubien by the king of Spain, the land was held during the middle decades of the nineteenth century by Beaubien's son-in-law, Lucien Maxwell. Grant of Kingdom is Fergusson's fullest, most<br />illuminating treatment of southwestern history. History, indeed, is the book's subject– not just historical facts, but the meanings inherent in the facts. In his foreword to the novel the author makes<br />clear that he intends not only to develop a specific fragment of regional history but also to project a much wider vision of man's collective experience. Like the South's William Faulkner, Fergusson in<br />Grant of Kingdom effectively uses the history of a plot of land– &quot;a postage stamp of soil,&quot; in Faulkner's phrase–as a microcosm of a region's past; as Faulkner is said to have fashioned a &quot;legend<br />of the South&quot; from the history of Yoknapatawpha County, so from the story of the Maxwell Land Grant Fergusson creates his legend of the American West. <br /><br />Once again, in Grant of Kingdom as elsewhere in his fiction, Fergusson is concerned to show the workings of change on individuals and societies. Jean Ballard–an extension of Wolf Song's<br />Sam Lash–is for a long while an energetic swimmer in the current of change. An ex-mountain man, he marries into the Coronel family and is transformed into el patron, &quot;the absolute ruler of a<br />minor kingdom, strictly feudal in its social structure.&quot; He establishes order by means of personal loyalty, rather than by smoothly functioning organization. Almost by force of personality alone, he<br />brings peace, prosperity, and civilization to his grant, and his life's labors result in progress for an entire region. By the time he dies, however, Ballard is a human relic. He possesses no business<br />sense, distrusting banks and risky investments. Inevitably he runs afoul of the go-for-broke economic system that settled over the West in the latter decades of the nineteenth century. For Ballard late in<br />life, &quot;work and physical danger are simple things to deal with. What makes life hard is the bewilderment of change and complication, the rush of people and money, the impact of unexpected things. . .<br />.&quot; <br /><br />With the intrusion of railroads and money into what had been, even in Ballard's heyday, an unspoiled wilderness, an irrevocable change is worked: these instruments of modern society &quot;destroyed one<br />kind of man and created another.&quot; The man they create is the wheeler-dealer speculator and financier, Major Blore. Blore, for better or worse, is a &quot;modern man&quot; in every sense of the term. He<br />understands the importance of proper organization, and he knows how to use money and technology. His lust for money and power springs from his childhood status as a poor white in the<br />class conscious South, and he discovers in the newly opened West a formative society in which he may freely indulge his savage ambitions. Naturally Blore delights in toppling so exalted an aristocrat<br />as Jean Ballard. He wrests control of the grant from the aged Ballard, divides it into small ranches and homesteads, and sells out at an enormous profit. However, Blore's dream of a populous city on<br />the grant eventually withers and dies when the railroad passes the area by. <br /><br />Of novels set in the nineteenth-century West, Grant of Kingdom is certainly one of the most suggestive and illuminating. It is chronologically inclusive, yet compact. It convincingly displays in<br />microcosm the stages of social development, the cultural and technological forces, the procession of character types that shaped the history of the West. In reviewing the book when it first appeared, J.<br />Frank Dobie said that Grant of Kingdom, though perhaps defective in minor ways, would endure as a work of art because it somehow evokes the unique tempos of both &quot;earth and metal.&quot; Dobie's<br />focus on narrative rhythm is very much to the point in evaluating the novel's effectiveness. The story–and the style in which it is told–advances not only with the leisurely pace of a great pastoral<br />kingdom, but also with the clangorous urgency of invading money and machinery. With grace and wisdom, Grant of Kingdom suggests both the tragic disruption and the hopeful promise of time<br />and change–and that, after all, is the dramatic rhythm of all human history, not just western history. <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C128">128</a></span> baptise Alexis Hyppolite Beaubien, fils de Paul Beaubien, seigneur de l;Ile Moras et de Charlotte Durocher.
