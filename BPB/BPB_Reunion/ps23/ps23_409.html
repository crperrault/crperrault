<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Lucien Bonaparte Maxell</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1637">1637</a></span>  On January 8, 1841, Charles Beaubien and Guadalupe Miranda, two Mexican citizens living in Taos, petitioned the Mexican government for a large grant of land along the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains neighboring the Santa Fe Trail. They wanted to raise sugar beets and &quot;establish manufactories of cotton and wool, and raising stock of every description.&quot; Three days later Governor Manual Armijo approved the request. In February 1843 having done little more than &quot;pull up weeds&quot; Beaubien and Miranda applied for title to the grant and were promised that it was forthcoming. However, their claim was contested by the curate of Taos, Father Antonio Jose Martinez, who charged that some of the lands had been given to the Pueblo Indians prior to the 1842 petition. Believing that land should be given to the poor and not the rich, Father Martinez would argue against awarding the grant until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed in 1848 and the government of the United States formally recognized all legitimate Mexican land grants. For the next 50 years these same concerns would be echoed by another man of the cloth. Beaubien intended to pass control of the Grant down to his son, Narcisco, but after renegades killed his son during the Taos Revolt of 1847, management and ultimately ownership of the Grant passed to his son-in-law, former trapper and explorer Lucien Maxwell.<br /><br />Lucien Bonaparte Maxwell was born in Kaskaskia, Illinois, on September 14, 1818, the son of a well-to-do merchant. When Maxwell's father died in 1834, Lucien traveled west through Nebraska and Kansas to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico learning the fur trade. In May of 1842 he hired on as chief hunter for an expedition led by explorer John C. Fremont. This was the first of five major scientific expeditions Fremont would make to map and explore lands west of the Mississippi River. Accompanying Fremont as guide was Kit Carson (1809-1868), a close friend of Maxwell. For Carson and Fremont, the expedition would bring fame; for Maxwell, respect, admiration and the skills needed to build an empire. But Maxwell was not yet ready to settle down. He and Carson joined Fremont for at least part of the second and third expeditions to Oregon and California in 1843-44 and 1845-46, with Maxwell returning to Taos in 1844 long enough to marry Beaubien's daughter, Luz, and do a little farming near Cimarron. In late January of 1847, while waiting at Bent's Fort for a ride home, Maxwell got word of a terrible massacre in Taos a few days earlier. He hurried back to find that Beaubien's son had been killed along with the governor and other officials. Maxwell was called for jury duty during the trial of those charged with starting the uprising. Later that fall Luz became pregnant with their first child, Peter, who was born the following April. With adventure behind him and thoughts of raising a family before him, Maxwell accepted his father-in-law's offer to manage the Land Grant.<br /><br />Interest in settling the Cimarron area had begun as early as the spring of 1844 when Beaubien and Miranda built a cabin on the Ponil River near the present day Chase Ranch. In March of 1848 Maxwell and a small group of men started over the mountains to Rayado from Taos. Snows had initially delayed the trip but the men finally arrived and set up temporary quarters. More supplies were needed so Maxwell and some others left for Kansas to purchase them. On the return trip Indians ambushed the party in Raton Pass and Maxwell was seriously wounded. He spent the rest of the year recuperating in Taos while working for his father-in-law. In April of 1849, Maxwell convinced Carson to join him at Rayado. Maxwell knew that the time would come when soldiers would be needed to safeguard travelers along the Santa Fe Trail and if a fort were to be built what better site than at Rayado, the junction between a trail to Taos and the main road to Santa Fe. Thus Maxwell and Carson crossed the mountains to Rayado to begin life anew. To Lucien, Rayado was the perfect site to build a home. There was plenty of water for irrigation, the climate was one of the best in New Mexico, being neither too cold in winter nor too hot in summer, the area was relatively free from Indians and the views were impressive. The Santa Fe Trail would guarantee a steady supply of goods and visitors. Maxwell built a large house and several smaller outbuildings with Carson adding a much smaller adobe hut to the complex. By July the inhabitants of Rayado numbered over 40.<br /><br />By the late Spring of 1850, military officials had agreed to create a &quot;Post at Rayado.&quot; Quarters were soon built and Maxwell entered into an agreement with the Army whereby he would be paid for providing food, lodging and supplies to the troops. However, by the following year the army decided that a small post ten miles north of Rayado in Cimarron as well as a larger fort 30 miles south on the Mora River would better serve the area. Some of the Rayado troops then moved south to begin construction of Fort Union at the junction of the Mountain and Cimarron Cutoff branches of the Trail. By 1857 relatively few Indians remained in the area. Most of the money Maxwell had earned in the preceding years had gone to his father-in-law so Maxwell decided to strike out on his own. Eleven miles to the north on the banks of the Cimarron River a settlement was prospering. The river was larger than the Rayado and the broad river valley more fertile and the surrounding mesas afforded better protection from Indian attacks. After selling his interest in Rayado, Lucien bought some of the remaining shares of the Land Grant from his relatives. At the end of 1858, feeling in complete control for the first time, Maxwell moved his family to Cimarron where he was appointed Postmaster and Indian Agent.<br /><br />Charles Beaubien died on February 10, 1864, and Beaubien's partner, Guadalupe Miranda, had fled south after the Taos Revolt. Within two years of his father-in-law's death, Maxwell had managed to purchase additional deeds to that part of the Grant he had not inherited. It was starting to get crowded in Cimarron. With the Civil War over, ex-soldiers with nothing to do drifted west. In 1865, former guide and trapper &quot;Uncle Dick&quot; Wootton constructed a toll road over Raton Pass, which made the mountains so much easier to cross that the Mountain Branch of the Santa Fe Trail became the preferred route of travel. But something even more important happened. In October of 1866, three men traveled to Moreno Valley and began to investigate a promising stream flowing down from Baldy Mountain. Gold! By Spring the rush was on. Settlements like Baldy Town, Elizabethtown and Virginia City sprouted like mushrooms. Some prospectors made over $1,000 a day. Maxwell became rich by leasing out land to the miners. When Colfax became a county in 1869, Elizabethtown was made the County Seat and Maxwell was elected probate judge.<br /><br />But all this excitement and activity was not for Lucien. He had succeeded in settling the Grant: land had been cultivated, towns had been built, Indians had been subdued and moved. Now that gold had been found and he was in firm control of the land, perhaps the Grant could be sold. Maxwell had the land surveyed and soon found buyers. On January 28, 1870, Maxwell sold almost 2,000,000 acres of land to a group of Colorado investors fronting for an English company for $1,350,000. In October Maxwell bought and moved into the buildings of the former military post at Fort Sumner. Aside from organizing the First National Bank of Santa Fe, Maxwell's business ventures did not fare well. He soon slipped into semi-retirement and turned over most of his business affairs to his son Peter. On July 25, 1875, Lucien B. Maxwell died at the age of 56, his body buried in the cemetery at Fort Sumner. An editorial in the Las Vegas, NM Gazette presented a fitting summary of his life. &quot;Against Lucien B. Maxwell, no man can say aught, and he died after an active and eventful life, probably without an enemy in the world. Of few words, unassuming and unpretentious, his deeds were the best exponent of the man. He was hospitable, generous and upright, and dispensed large wealth acquired by industry and genius with an open hand to the stranger and the needy.&quot;<br /><br />                        Much of this information came from a wonderful pamphlet produced<br />                        under the auspices of the Cimarron Historical Society, which can be<br />                        ordered by contacting the Cimarron Chamber of Commerce.<br />                        Cimarron Chamber of Commerce<br />                        104 North Lincoln Avenue<br />                        P.O.
