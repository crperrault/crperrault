<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Capt. Benezer Murdock Hingston</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C309">309</a></span> Served as a recruiter and guide for the British Army during the revolutionary war.  He lived in Freehold, Monmouth County, NJ on a large tract of land of 100 acres deeded to him by his father-in-law.  He also possessed another three pieces of land containing 85 acres.  Because of his activities with the British, his property was confiscated and later sold at auction by the Continental Government.  The sale took place at Freehold Court House in 1779.  Benezer fled the country in 1780, with his wife and children.    They returned to Ireland.   There is no evidence that Ben was in military service during this time in Freehold.  Perhaps he attained the rank of Captain in the Irish Volunteers after he returned to Ireland, in tribute to his service to the British  Forces.  <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1057">1057</a></span> Hingston, Benezer Murdock, of Freehold, New Jersey, son of Episcopalian Clergyman, the Reverend James Hingston.  Served as guide to the Royal Army and assisted in recruiting.  Permitted in 1780 to go to Ireland, where he had apparently come from.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1058">1058</a></span>  New Jersey - Monmouth, Inquisition hath been found against the following persons - - - -, Beuzeor Hinkson, (and others listed) - - - - and whereas proclamation hath been made in Court.

Whereas inquisitions have been found and final judgement entered thereon in favor of the State of New Jersey, against persons herein mentioned -- notice is hereby given that the real and personal estates belonging to ---- Benzeor Hinkson --- (others) --- of the Township of Freehold will be sold at the Freehold Courthouse, beginning Wednesday the 17th day of March next and continue from day to day until all are sold.  Samuel Forman, Joseph Laurence, Kenneth Hankinson, Commissioners, dtd February 17th, 1799.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C308">308</a></span> [p 44] second son of Rev james Hingston:<br /><br />Benezar, who served in America as captain in his majesty&#8217;s service during the War of Independence.  He married an  American lady, and had, with other issue, James, major in the army, at present lieutenant governor of Cape Coast Castle, in Africa.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1060">1060</a></span> [p 405] Hingston, Benezer Murdock of Freehold, Monmouth Co Memorial London 1784.  He is the second son of Rev James Hingston of Ireland, deceased.  Before 1776 he had a tract at Lower Freehold where he maintained his wife and several children.  He quit home to join the troops at Trenton and was hotly pursued by rebel horsemen.  His family were sent to join him at Perth Amboy with only the clothes they were wearing.  During the war he was employed as a guide.  He went from NY to Ireland where he arrived with his wife and four children in October 1780 and is now in great distress.  Claim for 85 acres on Millstone River (13/96/501-505)<br /><br />&#8220;At the end of each entry (in parentheses) will be found a note of all the PRO references to the claim which have been identified, beginning with AO 12 [Audit Office, AMerican Loyalist Claims]  and AO 13 and occasionally with the addition of other references.  The duplication evident within and between the various sets of documents is at the same time a safeguard and a scourge;  it is not uncommon to find up to half-a dozen variants on the same memorial, those written by the professionals usually redolent with oleaginous protestations of loyalty, devotion, outrageous suffering and undeserved pecuniary loss.  As an antidote, but also offering as a unique pen-portrait of the flesh-and-blood people involved, care has been  taken to balance such accounts by weaving in selected abstracts of personal revelations and correspondence, and with transcripts of some of the more revealing notes and evidences.  <br /><br />In 1788 the British Treasury initiated a series of pension books (now designated T 50/31-48 at the PRO) which recorded, quarter by quarter, the payments made to successful claimants.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1061">1061</a></span>  Benezer-Mordock [sic], formerly a capt in the army.
