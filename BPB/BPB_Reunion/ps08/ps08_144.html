<div class="psNotesData">Surgeon, professor, author, mayor of Montréal.  <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1091">1091</a></span> Irish Catholic origin.  Classical studies under the Sulpicians at the Petit Seminaire de Montréal.  Medical studies at McGill, then at the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, followed by time in great capitals of Europe.  He returned to Montréal in 1854 and became surgeon and professor of clinical surgery at Hotel-Dieu.  Chief of surgery in 1882.  He performed daring operations, such as the removal of a cancerous kidney in 1863, and he is believed to have been the first in Canada, if not in the world, to perform such an operation.  In 1872 he was the first in North America to undertake excision of a tongue and lower jaw.<br /><br />In 1871, he left Hotel Dieu to participate in the founding of the Bishop's College faculty of medicine in Montréal.  He became professsor of surgery at the Montréal school of Medicine and Surgery in 1875, then President of the school and dean, and he was still professor in 1891 when it merged with the Montréal branch of the Univesite Laval. <br /><br />He helped set up a number of medical organizations, including the Canadian Medical Association in 1867.  He was president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Québec 1886-9.  He participated in the incorporation of the Wonen's Hospital of Montréal in 1870 and the Samaritan's Hospital for Women in 1895.  <br /><br />He was elected mayor on Montréal from 1875-7, and proposed measures to improve the sanitary condition of the city.  Having recommended vaccination, his house was threatened by rioters.   He ran as Conservative candidate in House of Commons for Montréal Centre and lost but was named to the Senate in 1896.  <br /><br />He had several business interests: director then president of Montréal City and Savings Bank, president of Montréal Street Railway COmpany and Montréal Safe Deposit Co..<br /><br />He was knighted by Queen Victoria on 15 July 1895.  Vice president of British Assn for the Advancement of Science and honorary president of the British Medical Assn.<br /><br />[Andrea Hingston Dolan McNally] Sir William had a mansion on Sherbrooke between Metcalfe and Peel, since torn down. <br /><br />[Can. Men &amp; Women of their Time 1898] He belongs to an old Irish family and is nearly related to the Cotters, of Cork, the elder Latouches, of Dublin, and the Hales.  <br /><br />He was Chm of the local Bd of Health, organized during an epidemic of smalllpox and became Chm of the Prov Bd  of Health, appt during a similar visitation in 1885.  <br /><br />FOr the coolness and judgement displayed by him during the Guibord excitement in Montréal, he received the thanks of the then GG of Canada, the Earl of Dufferin.  DCL (Bishop's Coll Univ), LLD (hons) Victoria Univ, TOronto.  Commander of the Roman order of St-Gregory 1875.  <br /><br />Home 882 Sherbrooke St.  <br /><br />[Index toponymique des rues de Montréal] une rue a été nommée en son honneur à Montréal <br /><br />There was a major outbreak of smallpox in Montréal in 1885.  The first victim, a Grand Trunk Railway employee named George Longley, was brought to Hingston by Dr. Thomas Rodger, the railroad&#8217;s  official medical officer, after being rejected by the Montréal General Hospital, who claimed they had no isolation facilities.  Hingston, then affiliated with Hotel-Dieu Hospital, had him admitted there, the city&#8217;s isolation hospital for cases of this kind having been closed.  Hotel-Dieu tried unsuccessfully to isolate Longley, but the illness spread to other patients, who were eventually sent home so the hospital could be disinfected.  Although Hingston had been a major proponent of public health measures in Montréal, in particular during his stage as mayor in 1875-7, and although he played a major role in the development of measures to combat the 1886 epidemic, he is nonetheless considered one of the major culprits for the outbreak.  <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C930">930</a></span> Il devint maire le 1er mars 1875, ayant battu Jean-Louis Beaudry (futur maire) 5013 voix contre 658.  Il fut réélu par acclamation le 2 mars 1876 et quitta la mairie le 1-3-1877.   <br /><br />         Il eût à faire face à une émeute de chômeurs, au Champ de Mars en 1875 et leur dit &#8220;Messieurs, vous n&#8217;êtes pas des criminels.  Vous réclamez la subsistance, le boire, le manger, un logis convenable.  Vous réclamez du travail.  Éloignez-vous sans crainte, ayez espoir.  Des aujourd&#8217;hui des mesures d&#8217;urgence vont être prises pour vous aider&#8221;<br /><br />         Suivant une épidémie de variole de l&#8217;été 1875, les autorités avaient rendu obligatoire la vaccination.  De graves émeutes suivirent.  En 12-1876, Hingston fiat adopter à Québec une réorganisation du bureau de santé qui en fait un organisme permanent et le séparé du service de la police.  Mais la vaccination continuera longtemps à avoir des ennemis:  le bureau de santé est retourné à la police en 1979, et la vaccination ne sera effective que dans les années 1900.  Hingston met en chantier la construction d&#8217;un égout collecteur, rue Craig (St-Antoine).

His father, a native of Ireland, was lieutenant-colonel in the Royal 100th Regiment (The Dublins) and died when his son was only eighteen months old, leaving the family in debt on an estate granted to him for military service. Young Hingston was brought up in poverty, but his mother succeeded in solving her difficulties so well as to be able to send him to the Sulpician College at Montreal. Although he had carried off a prize in every subject in his first year he had to become a drug clerk in order to earn his living. His pocket-money was spent for lessons in the classics. Then he took up the study of medicine, still continuing his occupation, and graduated at McGill University in 1851. He had nearly £100 saved, so he at once sailed on a small vessel to Edinburgh, then famous for its teaching of surgery. He became a favourite of both Simpson and Syme, and Sir James Y. Simpson wanted to retain him as his assistant. Before his return at the end of two years young Hingston had with the expenditure of a very small amount of money visited every important medical centre in Europe, attracting attention everywhere by his talent and industry. <br /><br />He soon acquired a large practice in Montreal, to which his self-sacrifice during the cholera epidemic greatly contributed. In 1860 he became surgeon to the Hôtel-Dieu. He was the first surgeon in America to perform a resection of a diseased elbow and several other important operations. In 1882 he became professor of clinical surgery at Victoria University, Montreal. After its union with Victoria, he occupied this chair in Laval University. In 1875 he became Mayor of Montreal and was re-elected by acclamation, but declined a third term. For the wise discharge of his duties he received the thanks of Governor-General Dufferin. He became an acknowledged leader of American surgery and delivered the address on surgery in America before the British Medical Association in 1892. In 1895 he was knighted by Queen Victoria; in 1896 he was called to the Senate of Canada. Pius IX made him a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, Leo XIII conferred on him the Cross &quot;Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice&quot;, and he received honorary degrees from four universities. In 1885 he published &quot;The Climate of Canada and its Relation to Health&quot;. <br /><br />The Montreal Medical Journal (March, 1907); The Canadian Messenger (April, 1907). <br /><br />JAMES J.

They were commanded by an Irish lieutenant named James Fitzgibbon, who took the surrender of many of the Americans.
