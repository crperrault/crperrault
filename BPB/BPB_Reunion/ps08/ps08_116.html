It was renumbered the 99th in 1816 and then disbanded at Chatham in 1818.

I went on the Mormon site, and there's a birth for a Jane Hingston 29 Aug 1809 in Niagara Falls, father Samuel Hingston, mother Winifred, so it looks like there might be something to this. I couldn't understand her source so I'll check it with her and get back to you.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1079">1079</a></span>  He enlisted in the Royal Irish Artillery at 19.  His regiment disbanded in 1803 and he was discharged with the rank of corporal.  He then &#8220;served in and disciplined a corps of Yeomen infantry before signing up in 1804 with HM 100th Regmt of Foot&#8221;.  He arrived in Quebec City on Nov 14 1805.  Two years later when the regmt moved to Montreal, his wife Winifred left Ireland and joined him.  Her parents thereupon disowned her.  <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C587">587</a></span>  He saw action at Ft Erie, Sackett&#8217;s Harbour, Black Rock and Plattsburgh.  He took a bullet in the groin at the Battle of Chippewa, a ghastly engagement on the Niagara Peninsula on July 5 1814 between the invading American forces under Gen Winfield Scott and the British forces under the command of Phineas Riall, a Tiperary Irishman.  At the end of the day, 800 men, including Hingston&#8217;s orderly. were killed, wounded or MIA.  Neither side had gained an inch.  Hingston lost his kit in the battle and wasted no time in filing for fifty British pounds in damages.  &#8220;I was severely wounded and and my servant who had care of my baggage was killed in the same engagement&#8221; H wrote to his superiors.  &#8220;I was obliged to be conveyed to the rear as fast as I was able to be conveyed, &amp; I call, sir, on you, to bear testimony of my not deviating in the smallest degree from orders.  I was afterwards obliged to proceed to York for the recovery of my wound, by which I was deprived of any recourse to where my baggage was [before the action] by the advance of the enemy. &#8220; The claim was paid.  When the war ended in Aug 1814, H&#8217;s regiment was disbanded and Sam retired on half pay.  Eleanor McGrath was still present in his life, taking care of Thomas and Sarah, but their relationship had changed.  On April 15, 1815 he married her &#8220;outside the rail,&#8221; at the St Gabriel St Presbyterian Church, the Scottish kirk that used to stand at the western end of the Champs de Mars.  ... Sam&#8217;s children from his first marriage would be brought up as Protestants, but Eleanor&#8217;s would be raised RC.  They would have no children of their own until the children from his first marriage were self-sufficient and not until Sam had put the army behind him.  In 1823, in recognition of Sam Hingston&#8217;s service to king and country, he and his eldest son, THomas, now twenty-one, were given title to two adjoining parcels of land, Lots 31 and 32 along the Chateauguay river in the fifth range of the Township of Hinchinbrooke, 75 km SW of Montreal.  For the first time since they met, Sam and his wife had the stability she sought. [...] Sam H was an officer used to giving orders and having them obeyed but he wasn&#8217;t cut out for farming.  The land was too wet to be cultivated, so he tried to make a living making potash.  He walked with a limp, as the result of his war wounds, and according to one account, &#8220;he was rarely seen in his fields except on horseback,&#8221; riding  and hunting with his cronies and generally neglecting the property.   He served as a local school trustee and organized a militia unit, the Fourth battalion of the Beauharnois Regmt and became its lieutenant colonel.  His rise through the military was quite unusual for a commoner at the time.  He was elderly when he was made a lieutenant and that he continued to be promoted through the ranks was an indication of his ability.  [...] Early in Nov 1830, while stalking deer on his property, H was thrown from his horse and injured.  While he was recuperating, he caught the pneumonia that killed him on Nov 29,. 1830.  He died after what The Gazette described as &#8220;a short but painful illness which he bore with marked resignation.&#8221;   His obituary reported his death &#8220;without a struggle leaving his wife and five children to lament the loss of a kind husband and an indulgent parent.&#8221;  He was buried on his homestead with full military honours, coins on his eyes as the custom.  His grave, enclosed by a low stone wall, is still there on private property near the Chateauguay River, one km west of Athelstan.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C157">157</a></span> [marriage, copie gardée] Samuel James HIngston, Lieutenant and Adjutant Hundredth Regiment of Foot and Eleanor McGrath of Montreal, Spinster, both of the age of majority were joined in marriage by License from his Excellency Sir George Prevost, Bart, Captain General and Governor in Chief in ?? the province of Lower Canada, at Montreal this 11th day of April 1815 in presence of these witnesses<br /><br />S J Hingston<br />E McGrath<br />Th Dawson<br />Thomas McGrath<br />E?
