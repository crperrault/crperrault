<div class="psNotesData"><a href="http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/24815741/person/12801633553/mediax/2?pgnum=1&amp;pg=0&amp;pgpl=pid%7CpgNum">http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/24815741/person/128...0&amp;pgpl=pid|pgNum</a><br /><br />This explanation was submitted by Mona Rainville&nbsp;on Rootsweb<br /><br /><a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.anc">http://archiver.rootsweb.anc</a> <a href="http://estry.com/th/read/QUEBEC-RESEARCH/2006-10/1160188465">estry.com/th/read/QUEBEC-RESEARCH/2006-10/1160188465</a><br /><br />The marriage contract:<br /><br />Dated July 28th, 1697, it was drafted by Notary CHAMBALON, at the house of Sieur PINAULT on Notre-Dame Street, in Québec City.<br /><br />Therein Katherine STEVENS or STEPHENS is referred to as Marie Françoise NESTIVUES. This could very well be a rendition of &quot;né STEVENS&quot; even if Chambalon does not leave a space between NE and STIVUES. It could also be a rendition of N. STEVENS...more about this, later.<br /><br />This mariage contract spells out part of Katherine's - known as Marie Françoise - story:<br /><br />The Sieur Nicolas PINAULT, merchant in Québec, gives away the futur&nbsp;bride, which is described as &quot;Marie Françoise NESTIVUES, daughter born&nbsp;in New England, in a place called Ab?qadois (one letter, possibly an &quot;s&quot;&nbsp;scatched out), a minor of about 19 years of age as she so declares, and&nbsp;being unable to recall the baptismal name of either her father or&nbsp;mother, both deceased, nor the surname of her mother, for both of them&nbsp;died when she was a mere child, and moreover she was taken prisonner ten&nbsp;years ago by the Savages our allies from whom she was presently redeemed&nbsp;into the service of the said Sieur PINAULT...&quot;<br /><br />Her dowery consists of 200 Livres, not an unsubstantial sum, which she&nbsp;has received as a gift from Mr. Jean FREDAIN, secretary to Monseignor de&nbsp;CHAMPIGNY Intendant of New France, as well as whatever personal effects&nbsp;she has earned in this country through her work.<br /><br />This mariage contract, drawn up a mere three days prior to the actual&nbsp;mariage, does not mention the name of the mother. In fact it clearly&nbsp;states Marie Françoise does not remember her mother's name, nor her&nbsp;father's first name. Her father is named therein as NESTIVUES, whom,&nbsp;had he been a Native, would no doubt have been described as such:&nbsp;&quot;sauvage de Nation&quot; or something of that nature. There is no such mention.<br /><br />Now the marriage record:<br /><br />On August 1st, 1697, three days after the signing of the marriage&nbsp;contract, father DUPRÉ parish priest of the parish of Notre-Dame in&nbsp;Québec, sits down at his table after having blessed the marriage of&nbsp;Jacques PAQUET and Marie Françoise STEVENS, and records the following&nbsp;into his Parish Register (translation):<br /><br />&quot;On the first day of August 1697, after the publication of three bans of marriage, the first on the 23rd, the second on the 26th, and the 3rd on the 28th of the month of July of the above stated said year, between Jacques PACQUET son of Maurice PACQUET and of Françoise FORGETTE his father and mother from this parish et bishopric on the part, and Marie Françoise daughter of NESTYUS and of Marie MERAY likewise her father and mother of this parish and bishopric on the other part, and no cause of ... having been discovered, I François DUPRÉ parish priest of Québec did marry and give them the nuptial blessing according to the form prescribed by our Mother the Holy church, in presence of Maurice PACQUET father of the groom, Pierre PACQUET oncle, and François and Louis PACQUET also his brothers and Jean PARADIS brother-in-Law, and S. DU BREUIL who has signed the other above-stated having declared not being able to sign as likewise did the groom and the bride. (s) DU BREUIL; (s) Marie LE ROY fame de Mr DUPLESIS; (s) F. DUPRÉ; (s) Louise DOUAIRE; (s) Marie Anne DENIE&quot;.<br /><br />Throughout the parish register someone other than the original writer, and possibly at a later time, made an annotation next to each act, to indicate whether it is a baptism, a marriage, or a burial, and thus to facilitate research. It is of no consequence here as it merely repeats what is said in the act.<br /><br />W ho, then, are the mysterious NESTIVUES / NESTYUS and Marie MERAY named as parents of Marie Françoise?<br /><br />It has been suggested by some that Marie Françoise STEVENS is the daughter of a Thomas STEVENS and Mary CASWELL, and that it follows that &quot;NESTYUS and Marie MERAY must then be Marie-Françoise's adoptive parents. That simply cannot be.<br /><br />In October 1695, Captain Mathew CAREY from Boston arrives in Quebec on&nbsp;official business to redeem the New England captives held in New France. He redeems only 22 of the three times as many persons held here. Two persons by the name of STEPHENS are not redeemed. The first one, a boy named John, and the second, a girl named Katherine STEPHENS. The list that was drawn up of those that were redeemed and of those that were not, is the first document available to us which sheds some light on the true identity of our Miss STEVENS. She is Katherine STEPHENS, and she is not to be redeemed by CAREY.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />It would be interesting to see if any other document remains from the&nbsp;visit of Captain CAREY, perhaps a list of the missing, perhaps an&nbsp;explanation as to why Katherine - and John - were not redeemed. But to&nbsp;date, none has been found. I rather suspect that, even though Katherine&nbsp;STEPHENS did not know her own mother's name, Captain CAREY did and&nbsp;conveyed this information during his visit to Quebec, if for no other&nbsp;reason than to identify those remaining and those redeemed.<br /><br />There is evidence, however, that those persons who were not redeemed by&nbsp;CAREY were thereafter redeemed by various prominent members of the New&nbsp;France society, to be put into domestic service (possibly to repay the&nbsp;cost of their freedom).<br /><br />In the case of Katherine STEPHENS, she entered into service for Nicolas&nbsp;PINEAU starting in 1695. Some form of written contract must have&nbsp;preceded this arrangement, but I have not yet located it, and it may no&nbsp;longer exist.<br /><br />In her marriage contract, Katherine STEVENS claims to have been roughly&nbsp;19 years old at the time of her marriage. This places her birth in the&nbsp;neighborhood of 1678. Thomas STEVENS was then two or three years old,&nbsp;and only married Mary CASWELL in 1699! They are clearly not her parents.&nbsp;<br /><br />Who, then?<br /><br />According to FARMER in his opus &quot;A Genealogical Register of the First&nbsp;Settlers of New England&quot;, a Nathaniel STEVENS and Mary ...? (possibly&nbsp;MURRAY, from a different source) are the parents of a Katherine STEVENS&nbsp;born on 23 April 1676 in Salisbury, Maine. This Katherine was taken&nbsp;prisoner on Aug 5, 1689 at Pemaquid. She would then have been 13 years&nbsp;old if you accept 1676 as her birth year, or 11 if you stick with the&nbsp;age she declares in her marriage contract. Either way, this bit checks&nbsp;<br /><br />out with our Marie Françoise's story. Until 1695, this young girl remains at the Abenakis Catholic Mission near Quebec City.Enters Captain Mathew CAREY with a list of missing pilgrims, among which is possibly the daughter (and possibly son) of one Nathaniel STEVENS, or N. STEVENS, or ......NSTEVENS.<br /><br />The distance from NSTEVENS to NESTIVUES is just one very very short semantic step...ain't it?</div>
