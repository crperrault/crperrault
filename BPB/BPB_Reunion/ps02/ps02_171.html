Mr. Bennington had a sharp attack of pneumonia about two or three months ago, but he partially recovered, and was able to venture out again in spite of his advanced age. He visited Stockton on January 9, and presided at a meeting of the directors of the Stockton Malleable Iron Company, and then appeared,though weaker, to be in his usual health. It was not till January 23 that he complained of being ill, and he had been suffering since that time from congestion of the lungs, and he passed peacefully away on Wednesday morning. Mr. Benington was born in November 1802 at Skeffling a village situated near the mouth of the Humber, and was left in orphan at the age of 18. He was educated at the well-known friends school at Ackworth, and afterwards served his apprenticeship to a  grocery and provision business at Scarborough. He subsequently was in business as a wholesale grocer at Wakefield; but in 1835 he came to Stockton, where he entered into a partnership with a Mr. Smith, and traded under the name of Smith and Benington, wholesale groceries and provision merchants, their place of business being in the High street. In 1847 they remove to Silver street and took over the business of Sanders and Weatherall trading under the name of Andrew Sanders Successors. At a later date Mr. John Dobson joined Mr. Benington and for a year. The firm was styled Benington Dobson and Co. After their dissolution Mr. Benington took along with him his two sons in the firm became known as William Benington and Sons under which style it still continues to flourish, for Mr. Benington had long since ceased as active participation in its work. Mr. Benington was always of a sanguine temperament, and was ready at all times to assist in the commercial development of Stockton. He was a member of the original cast iron company, and a proprietor of the old Stockton blast furnaces, while he was also a director of the Durham District bank, which came to grief many years ago. He had great faith in the future of the iron and steel trades, and took a close interest in the welfare of the Stockton malleable iron company, of which directorate he was chairman. He was for many years a member of the Stockton Corporation, representing the Northwest Ward, and in 1869 he occupied the civic chair with great ability, and earned the thanks of the Council for the manner in which he conducted their business. He built Rimswell, a mansion in the district and Road in 1875, about a mile and a half outside Stockton, and continue to reside there to his removal to Scarborough in 1892. He was a member of the Stockton Board of guardians, and he was the oldest surviving member of the borough bench, his name having been placed on the commission of the peace so far back as 1862. He continued to take a keen interest in the work of both these authorities up till the time of his departure from Stockton. Mr. Benington was an ardent supporter of temperance, and was one of the founders of the Stockton Temperance Society, of which he has been president, while he was one of the trustees of the Temperance Hall. Mr. Benington came of the family in which longevity is a feature and he leaves a brother in America two years younger than himself who is engaged and farming and enjoys excellent health. Mr. Benington was a sturdy liberal throughout his life, and a great admirer Mr. Gladstone. He belonged to the Society of Friends and was generous and promoting their various philanthropic schemes.<br /><br />On failure of Northumberland and Durham District Bank<br /><a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/historyofbanksba00philrich/historyofbanksba00philrich_djvu.txt">http://www.archive.org/stream/historyofbanksba00ph...a00philrich_djvu.txt</a><br />but no mention of a Benington<br /><br /><a href="http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/20790/pages/3994">http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/20790/pages/3994</a><br />1847 11 9 Alexander Sanders and Joseph Weatherall assign their individual and joint assets and debts to William Backhouse and Alexander George Gray.
