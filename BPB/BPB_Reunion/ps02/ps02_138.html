<div class="psNotesData">See Edward Benington's notes of 1978.  <br /><br />Sent to Canada to open a branch of his father's tea business, British <br />and Benington.  The operation lost $100,000 in the first two years, <br />and he was fired by his father.  He became a journalist, being, among <br />other things, the science editor of the New York World.  His hobby <br />was Dante, and his knowledge of italian was good enough for him to <br />get the job of heading the US Information Agency in Italy during WWI. <br />Made Commander of the Crown of Italy by Victor Emmanuel.  Made <br />Knight Commander of the Order of Danilo by the Queen of Montenegro.  <br />He was then recalled from Montenegro by Woodrow Wilson for impolitic <br />remarks.  Born a Quaker, he converted to Catholicism and was active <br />in that church.  He helped Bishop Molloy choose over 100 stained <br />glass windows for the church of Queen of All Saints, Brooklyn.  <br />President of National Catholic Writers Guild.<br /><br />Harold Benington says that Arthur &quot;broke away from the Quaker Sect <br />shortly after coming to the United States and became a Roman <br />Catholic, in which faith his four sons were brought up&quot;.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Crown_of_Italy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Crown_of_Italy</a><br /><br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C320">320</a></span> [1871 census] 5, b Stockton<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C321">321</a></span> [1881 Census] at Bootham, Friends Boys School, York St Giles in Suburbs  (Bootham School, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootham_School">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootham_School</a>)<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C322">322</a></span> (p. 6)  Arrived in New York on Nov 16 1883 on RMS Bothnia, from Liverpool.

Quaker teachers were often trained at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flounders_Institute&action=edit&redlink=1"><u><font color="#0000f6">Flounders Institute</a></font></u> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackworth,_West_Yorkshire"><u><font color="#0000f6">Ackworth</a></font></u> and sometimes took a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_external_degree"><u><font color="#0000f6">London external degree</a></font></u> while teaching. Many had a keen interest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history"><u><font color="#0000f6">natural history</a></font></u> which was enthusiastically shared by the pupils and led to a serious interest in science at the school which went on to produce a number of distinguished scientists in many areas.<br />This scientific interest was in keeping with the intellectual developments in the city of York which in 1822 had formed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Philosophical_Society"><u><font color="#0000f6">Yorkshire Philosophical Society</a></font></u> (YPS). In 1853 Bootham became one of the first schools to have its own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observatory"><u><font color="#0000f6">observatory</a></font></u>, equipped with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractor"><u><font color="#0000f6">refracting telescope</a></font></u> manufactured by the notable York instrument maker <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cooke_%2528machinist%2529"><u><font color="#0000f6">Thomas Cooke</a></font></u>.<br />Quakers stressed the importance of a constructive use of leisure time. Many boys produced impressive essays and classified collections. Some, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvanus_P._Thompson"><u><font color="#0000f6">Silvanus P. Thompson</a></font></u> (Bootham 1858-67) became eminent in their field – he was a professor of science and worked with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday"><u><font color="#0000f6">Michael Faraday</a></font></u> on electromagnetism. In the late nineteenth century many of the Rowntree family sons were educated at Bootham, one of them, Arthur Rowntree, becoming Headmaster (1899–1927).</div>
