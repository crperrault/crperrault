<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for John Benington</div>

<div class="psNotesData">Lived at Media, near Philadelphia and lived to be over 100.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C373">373</a></span> [The Friend] citing The London Friend &#8220;John Benington, a few days ago the oldest Ackworth scholar living, passed away at his home in Media, PA, aged 100 years, 8 months and 26 days.  He was the brother of the late William Benington, of Stockton, and later of Scarborough, and uncle of the present George Benington, of Enfield.  In 1898 his great-nephew, George Henry Little, visited him just before entering his 99th year, and reported him &#8220;hale and hearty, working still in his garden; going down to the bank where, as a director, his clear judgement is highly valued&#8221;&#8221;  Last summer the Philadelphia Ledger said, Seventh Month 20th &#8220;John Benington today completed his one hundredth year.  He is revocering from a severe illness, and was able to be about his room today, accepting the greetings of Friends.  He lives with his daughter Margaret, much of whose ife has been devoted to the care of her father.  Among the visitors today was John Benington&#8217;s son Samuel, who came from Charlton Ia, to help his father celebrate his centyry birthday.  <br /><br />John Benington never used tobacco or intoxicants and has always observed regular hours for eating, rising and retiring.  The neighbors know that when hee shuutters of the Benington dwelling opened in the morning, it was 6 o&#8217;clock, and when they closed at night, it was 9 o&#8217;clock.  John Benington started in life without a penny, but succeeded in amassing quite a fortune.<br /><br />He was born in Yorkshire, England, emigrated to America when 20 years of age.  At the age of 24 he married Phoebe Pierce, afterwards purchasing a farm near London Grove, Chester Co,  He led the life of a farmer until 1890 when he removed to Media.  He is a member of the Society of Friends, and until his recent illness could always be found at his place in the Meeting House.  He is over siex feet in height with a splendid physique and has a constitution that is remarkable.  Ann Elfreth, of Philadelphia, is a daughter of the centenarian.  <br /><br />A boarding school at Achwirth Yorkshire ENgland, whiere John Benington attended in his youth has asked for a letter writtten on his one hundredth birthday, and he will comply.  <br /><br />In No 2 of the present volume of The Friend appeared a feeling tribute to John Benington&#8217;s lifetime fo a century.  Not many days before his decease he remarked to a Friend &#8220;Oue generation cannot legislate of fully provide for another, as each has its own need and methid oand service, which will be revealed to it&#8221;<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C371">371</a></span> [vol 74, 1900-7-28] &#8220;One week ago our venerable friend John Benington reached his one hundredth anniversary.  He was born as Skeffling, Yorkshire, ENgland the 20th of 7th Month 1800: was educated at Ackworth School, and upon the expiraiton of his apprenticeship to a grocer in Wakefield, came to this country to learn farming, a predisposition to lung trouble rendering open air life desirable.  <br /><br />Soon after his marriage with Phoebe Pierce in 1824, he settled on a farm in London Grove Pa, where he remained for 12 years, and then moved within the limits of Concord meeting; still later to the farm at Westtown, and in 1877, settled at Media, where he lives honored and beloved by his fellow citizens.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C362">362</a></span> student at Ackworth 1810-13<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C374">374</a></span> [Philadelphia immigration list] arrived 14 June 1819, Philadelphia from Liverpool on the Elizabeth.  <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C375">375</a></span> In the spring of 1853 her parents assumed the care of the farm belonging to Westtown Boarding School and she resided with them, assisting in the domestic duties of the house.  Her mother died while occupying this position, and in the spring of 1860, and a few weeks later the family moved to a farm at Glen Mills, Delaware Co PA, where they resided till the autumn of 1877, when they removed to Media, and became members of the Chester Monthly Meeting.</div>
