(<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 12</font></u>)<br /></b>Unlawful religious assemblies were being held at Edmonton in 1662 (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 13</font></u>) and it was said in 1666 that 'the head of the serpent', a reference to religious rebellion, dwelt in Edmonton and Enfield. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 14</font></u>) In the same year Arthur Jackson, an ejected London minister who had held conventicles, died at Edmonton. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 15</font></u>) There were 15 nonconformists at Edmonton in 1676. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 16</font></u>)<br />Most of the early nonconformists were probably Quakers. Gerard Roberts, a Quaker preacher, held a meeting there in 1669 (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 17</font></u>) and was among those indicted for attending conventicles in Edmonton in 1686. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 18</font></u>) Others indicted at the same time included Edward Mann, a London haberdasher who had a country house at Ford Green near Winchmore Hill, (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 19</font></u>) and Robert Chair, a Winchmore Hill smith. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 20</font></u>) George Fox was a frequent visitor and conventicles were held at both Mann's and Chair's houses during the 1680s. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 21</font></u>) Fox also visited several people in Southgate, including James Lowrey (d. 1726), merchant and coachman, (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 22</font></u>) and Bridget Austell, who kept a school there and at whose house a meeting was held in 1688. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 23</font></u>) Other Quakers of the 1680s included George Barr, a Londoner who had a house near Bury Street, (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 24</font></u>) and George Keith (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 25</font></u>) and Christopher Taylor, who kept schools in Edmonton. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 26</font></u>) William Shacker, who had a house in Bury Street ward in 1672, (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 27</font></u>) may have been the Shackler in whose yard a conventicle was held in 1686. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 28</font></u>) John Butcher (d. 1721), another Quaker, spent his last years at Palmers Green. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 29</font></u>) Quakerism came to be concentrated at Winchmore Hill, where John Oakley, a merchant tailor, offered his barn for meetings in 1682. A meeting-house was erected there in 1687, when John Freame and Thomas Gould, founders of Barclays Bank, were among those who gave assistance. Wealthy London merchants, especially bankers like the Barclay, Hoare, and Hodgkin families, maintained their connexion with the Winchmore Hill meeting-house, which they helped to rebuild in 1790. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 30</font></u>)<br />Isaac Walker was one of the Quaker trustees of 1790 and other brewers, like Jacob Yallowley of Whitbread's (d. 1801), who supported the Winchmore Hill Independent chapel, (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 31</font></u>) were prominent nonconformists in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Three silkbrokers were the trustees of Lower Edmonton Wesleyan chapel in 1853 (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 32</font></u>) but humbler tradesmen formed the bulk of nonconformist congregations and increasingly took control, (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 33</font></u>) as the rich moved out of Edmonton during the 19th century.<br />....<br />In 1851, out of a population of 9,708, the nonconformist chapels of Edmonton had a total attendance on census Sunday of 2,012. The Independents, with 1,613 attendances, formed 80 per cent of that total and were by far the largest denomination. The Wesleyans had 180 attendances (9 per cent), the Independent Calvinists 161 (8 per cent), and the Quakers 58 (3 per cent). The chapels were concentrated in and around Fore Street, particularly Upper Edmonton, and at Winchmore Hill. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 56</font></u>)<br />....<br /><br />The greatest activity by all denominations was between 1880 and 1914, a period of rapid growth, especially in working-class housing. Quakers opened a meeting in Southgate in 1904 and a mission at Winchmore Hill in 1907. <br />........<br /><br />The percentage of people attending nonconformist chapels nonetheless declined between 1851 and 1901, when the population multiplied six times, to 61,892, but attendances at chapels rose only three times, to 7,277. Edmonton had become a dormitory for predominantly workingclass Londoners who were not church- or chapelgoers. In the better-off suburbs, like New Southgate, most people were churchmen or women.<br />Among Protestant nonconformists the Congregationalists, with 3,203 attendances, still maintained their lead in 1903, although it had dropped from 80 to 45 per cent of the total. The Baptists, with 1,625 attendances, accounted for 22 per cent and the Methodists, with 1,291 attendances, for 18 per cent. The Salvation Army had 719 attendances (10 per cent), general evangelical missions had 307, and the Brethren had 77. The Quakers had 55 attendances, almost the same as in 1851, but they formed less than 1 per cent of the total. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 58</font></u>)<br />Had a religious census been taken since 1903, it would almost certainly have shown a further decline. In the period between the World Wars chapels moved from the old centres of population to the new suburban estates. The Methodists closed a chapel in New Southgate in 1936, replaced their chapel in Chase Side by one in the Bourne in 1929, and opened new chapels at Grange Park in 1921 and at Oakwood in 1939. The Baptists opened a new chapel in New Southgate in 1926 and replaced their chapel in Chase Side by one in Oakwood Park in 1935. There were no important developments among the Congregationalists but the Brethren expanded, registering halls in Victoria Road c. 1920 and Croyland Road in 1926, a chapel in Bowes Park in 1934, and a room in Bury Street in 1938. New sects appeared during the 1920s and 1930s. Spiritualists opened a church in Linnell Road in 1929 and a house in Green Lanes in 1941. Christian Scientists registered a house in Palmerston Road in 1937, the Seventh Day Adventists registered a hall in Bounces Road in 1937, and Pentecostalists opened a mission room in Cowper Road c. 1930. In 1929 another mission hall, in Hertford Road, was registered for undesignated Christians.<br />Since 1945 there has been a steady contraction. In New Southgate the Baptist chapel in South Road closed in 1954 and the Quaker meeting-house in 1969. <br />.........<br /><b>Society of Friends.<br /></b>A meeting-house was built at Winchmore Hill in 1687 to replace the barn used since 1682. It was ruinous in 1787 and in 1790 a new meeting-house was built on the same site, in what was later known as Church Hill. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 59</font></u>) It is a plain building of buff-coloured brick, described in 1819 as neat and substantial, and stands in a burial-ground which contains the remains of Dr. John Fothergill (d. 1780), the physician and botanist. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 60</font></u>) In 1819 the meeting-house accommodated 250 people although the congregation then consisted of fewer than 15 families. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 61</font></u>) On census Sunday 1851 the accommodation had contracted to 160, probably because a gallery had been removed. The attendance was then 42 in the morning and 16 in the afternoon. On census Sunday 1903 the attendance was 32 in the morning and 23 in the evening. From 1907 until 1954 the Quakers ran an adult school mission hall in Church Hill, Winchmore Hill. (<u><font color="#0c575f">fn. 62</font></u>)<br />A Quaker meeting opened in 1904 at the institute in High Road, New Southgate, and closed in 1969.

The aggregate average profits, taking the three years ended in Sept 30th 1896 are certified by Messrs Whinney, Smith and Whinney to have amounted to £11,816.  The premises have been valued as a going concern at £21,985.  The purchase price for the whole concern has been fixed at £140,000.  <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C348">348</a></span> [The Statist, Dec 5, 1896, p 870, image 870]<br />The freehold warehouses, Nos 118 and 118A, Southwark Street, of the British Tea and Trading Assoc Ltd, a little company formed in 1881, have been valued with the plant, machinery and fixtures, &#8220;for occupation and as a going concern&#8221; at the high price of £21,965; the stock in trade, &#8220;at or under cost price&#8221; is taken at £13,700; and bad debts, bills and cash at £14,885, making up £50,631.  It is now proposed to remove to Southwark Street the plant and machinery of Benington Bros and Corner -- also in the tea trade -- and that a new Company, with the title of British and Benington&#8217;s Tea Trading Association Ltd, with a nominal capital of £250,000 shall buy the assets of the two concerns for £140,000.   But why pay £140,000 for assets which on the vendor&#8217;s own showing, do not appear to be worth more than £50,000 or £55,000, irrespective of goodwill?  Both concerns, although not in a particularly large way of business, are respectable, but anything like £20,000 or £25,000 would, we are inclined to think, be regarded in the trade as a very high price for their goodwill, which apparently is considered as worth L90,000.  A purchase price of about one-half of that fixed by the vendors would seem to be much nearer the mark.  It is stated that the average annual profits of the two business for three years have been £11,816, but this is before deducting partners&#8217; salaries and management fees.  The proposed issue of capital at present is for L75,000 in Ordinary shares and £75,000 in Five per Cent.  Preference shares, which latter, it will be seen amount to £20,000 or L£5,000 more than the value of the whole of the above stated assets.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C78">78</a></span> [Toronto 1900] No mention of Li-Quor, or George Mann, and no tea merchant at 295 Yonge.

Entered according to Act of Parliament of the Dominion of Canada in the year 1883, by George Clarke, in the office of the Minister of Agriculture.  Preface signed Anne Clarke, 38 Pembroke St. Toronto, 1 Nov 1883.  Published as an American edition in Chicago, 1889.  <br /><br />Anne Clarke is not in Toronto city directories for the 1880s;  however, George Clarke (her husband?) who registered the book&#8217;s copyright is first listed in the 1882 directory as general manager of Li-Quor Tea Co of England, living at 473 Sherbourne St.  George Clarke had come to Toronto from England in 1881 (see entry for Li-Quor Tea Co in &#8220;History of Toronto and County of York, vol 1, Toronto: C. Blackett Robinson, 1885, p 466)  In the 1883 directory, George Clarke is again listed as general manager of Li-Quor Tea Co, but living at 38 Pembroke St., the address appended to Anne Clarke&#8217;s &#8220;Preface&#8221;.  He continues to be listed as living at 38 Pembroke St up to and including 1887, the last year that he appears in the directory, but the description of his business changes.  In 1884, his business is &#8220;books&#8221; at 100 Yonge St, and he is in the Businesses section of the directory under &#8220;Booksellers and Stationers&#8221;.  In 1885, his business is &#8220;teas&#8221; at 295 Yonge. In 1886 his business is &#8220;real estate&#8221; at 47 Toronto Arcade and proprietor of the Li-Quor Tea Co at 295 Yonge.  In 1887, a fuller form of his name is given, George K M Clarke, but his only business is real estate.  It appears that George Clarke was involved in bookselling for only one year, about the time of the cookbook&#8217;s publication in Nov 1883. (Hulse found no other information about George Clarke, apart from that in the 1884 Toronto directory).  The fact that the earliest identified American edition of the cookbook was published in 1889 in Chicago, two years after George Clarke disappeared from the Toronto directory, suggests that he may have moved to the United States, or that his business interests turned to that country;  however, I could find no clear match in Chicago city directories for 1888-90.  Another possibility is that Clarke moved to Halifax or Winnipeg, where Li-Quor Tea Co is supposed to have had branch houses (History of Toronto, p 466); however, I found no listing for Clarke or the Li-Quor Tea Co in Halifax directories for the period 1888 to 1890 or the Winnipeg directory for 1890.  <br /><br />&#8220;Mrs Clarke&#8217;s COokbook&#8221; was puboished by The National Tribune, Washington DC, 1909 (also 1899)<br /><br />Mrs Clarke's Cookery Book, Toronto, 1883<br />Canadian Cookbook Collection TX715.6 C54 &nbsp; The first Canadian cookbook to be published in American editions (under various titles, from 1889, e.g., The People's Cook Book, Chicago: The People's Publishing Co., 1889); enjoyed a huge distribution in Canada, under various titles, up to about 1920 (The Dominion Cook Book, The Hudson's Bay Cook Book, etc.); the author had an English connection and some of the recipes are related to ones in The Official Handbook for the National Training School for Cookery Containing the Lessons on Cookery Which Constitute the Course of Instruction in the School, compiled by R.O.C.
