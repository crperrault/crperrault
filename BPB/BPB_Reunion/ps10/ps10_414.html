<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Jack Leggett</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/31/arts/jack-leggett-pivotal-figure-in-creative-writing-dies-at-97.html?hpw&amp;rref=obituaries&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=well-region&amp;region">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/31/arts/jack-legget...ll-region&amp;region</a>=bottom-well&amp;WT.nav=bottom-well&amp;_r=0<br /><br />Jack Leggett, who nourished a generation of poets and novelists as director of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_iowa/index.html?inline=nyt-org"><u><font color="#0000e9">University of Iowa</a></font></u> Writers&#8217; Workshop, perhaps the nation&#8217;s pre-eminent graduate program in creative writing, died on Sunday in Napa, Calif. He was 97.<br />His death was confirmed by his son Anthony.<br />In the late 1960s, Mr. Leggett, who had been an editor and was a novelist himself, became a writer in residence at Iowa, where the workshop — officially known as the Program in Creative Writing — was founded in 1936 as the nation&#8217;s first advanced degree-granting program of its kind.<br />He took over its directorship in 1970, when the major expansion of college and graduate writing programs had yet to begin and, as he later described it, for good or ill the general profile of a writing student was beginning to change from that of an adventurer less interested in form than experimentation to that of a more academic technique-developer and craft-polisher.<br />&#8220;In 1970 there were a lot of kids out of the armed forces and the Peace Corps,&#8221; he said in a 1979 interview with The New York Times about his early students. &#8220;They were an undisciplined lot. They&#8217;d say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t tell me about form.&#8217; Now they are very interested in technique. They want to know what novelists have done in the past. And it shows in their work.&#8221;<br />Over almost two decades — he retired in 1987 — Mr. Leggett populated the faculty with well-known writers, including John Cheever, Ian McEwan, Raymond Carver, Jorie Graham, Frederick Exley, Gail Godwin, Barry Hannah, Donald Justice, James Alan McPherson, John Irving and Frank Conroy (Mr. Leggett&#8217;s eventual successor), and oversaw what became a hothouse of literary talent.<br />Among the students he admitted — manuscripts were and are a key element of a student&#8217;s application — were T. Coraghessan Boyle, Allan Gurganus, Michael Cunningham, Jane Smiley, Sandra Cisneros, Kent Haruf, Ethan Canin, Jayne Anne Phillips, Tracy Kidder, Denis Johnson and Bob Shacochis, many of whom returned to teach.<br />Owing in no small part to their success, the business of teaching creative writing is now widespread. In 1975, there were 15 master of fine arts programs in writing in the United States. Today, the nonprofit organization Poets &amp; Writers lists more than 200 in <a href="http://www.pw.org/mfa?degree=MFA&filter1=All&perpage=50"><u><font color="#0000e9">its database.</a></font></u><br />&#8220;Jack was a marvelous, generous, lighthearted, intelligent captain at the helm of this program,&#8221; <a href="http://writersworkshop.uiowa.edu/people/lan-samantha-chang"><u><font color="#0000e9">Lan Samantha Chang</a></font></u>, the director of the workshop since 2006, said in an interview. &#8220;One of his greatest gifts was that he was able to see talent at a relatively early stage. He made decisions for admissions that have really resulted in a great legacy for the program.&#8221;<br />John Ward Leggett was born in Manhattan on Nov. 11, 1917. His mother, the former Dorothy Mahar, died the next year in the influenza pandemic sweeping the world. His father, Bleecker Noel Leggett, managed real estate properties and was largely an absentee father. John was reared mostly by a grandmother.<br />He attended private schools, including the Manlius School (now the Manlius Pebble Hill School) near Syracuse, which included military training, but did not graduate. Instead he spent a year at Bard College and then returned to finish high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. He went on to Yale, graduated in 1942 and entered the Navy, serving in the Pacific theater during <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/world_war_ii_/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"><u><font color="#0000e9">World War II</a></font></u>.<br />Mr. Leggett worked in publishing in the 1950s and early &#8217;60s, first as a publicist and editor for Houghton Mifflin (now Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) in Boston and later as an editor for Harper &amp; Brothers, which became Harper &amp; Row and is now part of HarperCollins.<br />&#8220;In the early 1960s, John Leggett edited my first three books,&#8221; the writer Gay Talese said in an email, &#8220;and in socializing with him sometimes,&nbsp; at dinners or at&nbsp; book parties, I got my first impression of&nbsp; New York literary gentry, a small circle that included Louis Auchincloss, John Phillips Marquand and George Plimpton. He was a courteous and tweedy figure with an elite education, an understated wit — I think part of the end of the era when book publishing was a gentleman&#8217;s occupation. He was a gentleman himself, and as an editor wielded a gentle pencil.&#8221;<br />Mr. Leggett&#8217;s mantra to his Iowa students was &#8220;Write what you know,&#8221; and he kept his own counsel. For his first novel, <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-leggett-2/wilder-stone/"><u><font color="#0000e9">&#8220;Wilder Stone&#8221;</a></font></u> (1960), he drew on his relationship with his father. His 1969 novel, <a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/john-leggett-5/who-took-the-gold-away/"><u><font color="#0000e9">&#8220;Who Took the Gold Away,&#8221;</a></font></u> about mismatched college friends, recalled his time at Yale. And &#8220;Gulliver House&#8221; (1979) was about the publishing industry.<br />His other books include a biography of the novelist and playwright William Saroyan, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/05/books/review/05KINCAIT.html"><u><font color="#0000e9">&#8220;A Daring Young Man,&#8221;</a></font></u> published in 2002, when Mr. Leggett was in his 80s; and <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5300244"><u><font color="#0000e9">&#8220;Ross and Tom; Two American Tragedies&#8221;</a></font></u> (1974), a dual biography of two young best-selling novelists of the late 1940s — Ross Lockridge Jr., the author of &#8220;Raintree County,&#8221; and Thomas Heggen, who wrote &#8220;Mister Roberts&#8221; — each of whom committed suicide in the wake of his success.<br />&#8220;A fine example of literary and psychological investigation,&#8221; the critic Jonathan Yardley called the book in The New York Times Book Review. &#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Ross and Tom&#8217; is a modest book about two writers of modest accomplishment, but in its understated fashion it gets as close to the question of the price of literary success in America as anything since Jack London&#8217;s autobiographical novel, &#8216;Martin Eden.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;<br />Mr. Leggett&#8217;s first marriage, to Mary Lee Fahnestock, ended in divorce. In addition to his son Anthony, he is survived by his wife, the former Edwina Benington; two other sons, Timothy and John; and three granddaughters.<br />He and his wife lived in Napa Valley, where, after his retirement from Iowa, he continued his role as a literary Johnny Appleseed as director of the Napa Valley Writers&#8217; Conference for many years.<br />&#8220;If it can be said that any one person was responsible for Iowa City being celebrated as the center of gravity for the workshop culture in the literary life of America, that person was Jack Leggett,&#8221; said Mr. Shacochis, who won a <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/national_book_awards/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"><u><font color="#0000e9">National Book Award</a></font></u> in 1985 for a collection of stories, &#8220;Easy in the Islands,&#8221; written at the Iowa Workshop, and whose novel <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/books/review/bob-shacochiss-woman-who-lost-her-soul.html?pagewanted=all"><u><font color="#0000e9">&#8220;The Woman Who Lost Her Soul&#8221;</a></font></u> was a Pulitzer Prize finalist last year. &#8220;I could never have been a writer without his support.&#8221;<br /><br />[Napa Valley Register]<br />January 28, 2015 7:00 pm<br /><a href="http://napavalleyregister.com/obituaries/john-jack-leggett/article_2e9cf002-ba3c-5dc7-b1a5-89ac093c7c39.html#comments"><font color="#0000e9">(0)<u> Signatures</a></font></u><br /><br />John &#8216;Jack&#8217; Leggett<br />Enlarge Photo<br />1917-2015<br />John &#8216;Jack&#8217; Leggett<br />John &#8220;Jack&#8221; Leggett died in Napa on Sunday, Jan. 25, at age 97. He was active and still writing until shortly before his death.<br />After having spent 20 years at the helm of The Iowa Writers Workshop (at the University of Iowa), Jack retired to Napa and in 1986 was asked by Dave Evans to create fiction writing workshops for the Napa Valley Writers&#8217; Conference. Jack was involved steadily with the Conference every year after that. In Napa, he continued to write novels, biographies, newspaper articles, and collaborated on a widely distributed high school text book series called &#8220;The Elements of Literature.&#8221;<br />Born in New York City, in November 1917, his childhood was difficult, given that his mother, Dorothy Mahan, died in the 1918 flu epidemic. Lacking the basis of a strong family life, Jack spent an aimless youth with little parental direction and a longing for an absentee father, which later served as the basis for his first best-selling novel, &#8220;Wilder Stone,&#8221; published in 1960.<br />After graduating from Yale in 1942, Jack entered the Navy as a lieutenant, and served on the Destroyer Escort, USS Elden, in the Pacific until the end of World War II.<br />Returning to the states, Jack published short stories in publications such as McCall&#8217;s, and worked as a publicist and editor at Houghton Mifflin in Boston. Later in the 1960s Jack was an editor in New York City at Harper &amp; Row. His authors there included, among others, Gay Talese and Larry McMurtry.<br />In 1969, Jack was invited to join the faculty of the University of Iowa. By 1971, he was asked to take over as head of their prestigious creative writing program, with students such as Jane Smiley and Tracey Kidder. While there Jack wrote &#8220;Ross &amp; Tom: Two American Tragedies,&#8221; published to very strong critical success in August 1974. It was an examination of the life and untimely death of Ross Lockridge and Tom Heggen, two hugely successful authors of the late 1940s, who were unable to overcome writers block and succumbed to depression.<br />In &#8220;retirement,&#8221; Jack built a home in the hills above Napa, and often attributed his daily swims and walks up the hill behind his house as the key to his longevity. But it was mainly that he kept writing until his last days.<br />He is survived by his wife, Edwina Benington Leggett of Napa and San Francisco {and his stepchildren, Elliot Evers, John Evers (Cynthia), Anne Evers (Breck Hitz) and William Evers (Melinda Ellis), and their children}; Jack&#8217;s oldest son, Timothy (&#8220;Tim&#8221;) and his wife, Phyllis Leggett of Pittsgrove, New Jersey; his second son, John Leggett of Salt Lake City, Utah; and youngest son Anthony (&#8220;Tony&#8221;) and his wife, Claire Leggett; and their three daughters, Annalee, Mary-</div>
