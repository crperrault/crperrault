Toronto, The Grip printing and Publishing Co, 55 &amp; 57 Adelaide St E.   Entered according to Act of Parliament of the Dominion of Canada in the year 1883, by George Clarke, in the office of the Minister of Agriculture.  Preface signed Anne Clarke, 38 Pembroke St. Toronto, 1 Nov 1883.  Published as an American edition in Chicago, 1889.  <br /><br />Anne Clarke is not in Toronto city directories for the 1880s;  however, George Clarke (her husband?) who registered the book&#8217;s copyright is first listed in the 1882 directory as general manager of Li-Quor Tea Co fo England, living at 473 Sherbourne St.  George Clarke had come to Toronto from England in 1881 (see entry for Li-Quor Tea Co in &#8220;History of Toronto and County of York, vol 1, Toronto: C. Blackett Robinson, 1885, p 466)  In the 1883 directory, George Clarke is again listed as general manager of Li-Quor Tea Co, but living at 38 Pembroke St., the address appended to Anne Clarke&#8217;s &#8220;Preface&#8221;.  He continues to be listed as living at 38 Pembroke St up to and including 1887, the last year that he appears in the directory, but the description of his business changes.  In 1884, his business is &#8220;books&#8221; at 100 Yonge St, and he is in the Businesses section of the directory under &#8220;Booksellers adn Stationers&#8221;.  In 1885, his business is &#8220;teas&#8221; at 295 Yonge. In 1886 his business is &#8220;real estate&#8221; at 47 Toronto Arcade and proprietor of the Li-Quor Tea Co at 295 Yonge.  In 1887, a fuller form of his name is given, George K M Clarke, but his only business is real estate.  It appears that George Clarke was involved in bookselling for only one year, about the time of the cookbook&#8217;s publication in Nov 1883. (Hulse found no other information about George Clarke, apart from that in the 1884 Toronto directory).  The fact that the earliest identified American edition of the cookbook was published in 1889 in Chicago, two years after George Clarke disappeared from the Toronto directory, suggests that he may have moved to the United States, or that his business interests turned to that country;  however, I could find no clear match in Chicago city directories for 1888-90.  Another possibility is that Clarke moved to Halifax or Winnipeg, where Li-Quor Tea Co is supposed to have had branch houses (History of Toronto, p 466); however, I found no listing for Clarke or the Li-Quor Tea Co in Halifax directories for the period 1888 to 1890 or the Winnipeg directory for 1890.  <br /><br />[a poem at the beginning of Clarke&#8217;s cookery book suggests a connection to the National Training School for Cookery in South Kensington from which some of the recipes originate.  The superintendant of NTSC from 1873 to 1919 was Mrs Edith Clarke, wife of Charles Clarke.  Is there a connection?]<br /><br />Possible arrivals<br />NYC 1881-5-13 on Gloucester  in steerage<br />George Clarke 30 M Warehouseman<br />Mary A 25 wife<br />Adaline 2 <br /><br />Quebec May 1880 Waldensian<br />George Clarke 32 no occupation given, appears to be going to Toronto<br /><br />Cookery and Cooking Schools â€”The National School of Cookery, Exhibition-road, South Kensington, commenced its work in the year 1873 under the title of the Popular School of Cookery, and was located in the building of the International Exhibition of that year. At the close of the International Exhibition the commissioners granted to the executive committee of the National School of Cookery the temporary use, free of rent, of that portion of the building already occupied by it, together with some more space for an additional kitchen and offices. Up to the present time it has not been found possible for the school to provide its own premises, and therefore the use of the exhibition building is continued to it. Lectures and demonstrations are now given daily in this school by students going through a course of training as teachers. Cooks and others are instructed in all branches of cookery, and lessons can be had singly or in a course. The public are admitted to see the school at work every afternoon, except Saturday, between three and four o'clock. The Crystal Palace classes for cookery and domestic economy were commenced in the Ladies' Division of the School of Art, Science, and Literature in the year 1875. On the removal of the school to its present position in the tropical department of the palace, Miss Mary Hooper was entrusted with the formation of a new series of classes for instruction in cookery and every branch of domestic economy. These classes have been continued to the present time The instruction is given by practical illustrations, and is designed for ladies, from a lady's point of view, and not for the training of servants. It includes all that is necessary to make home comfortable and attractive, and a lady accomplished ruler of her own house. At each cookery lesson, two or more dishes are prepared which are tasted by the students. At this school single lessons are not given, and the number of students received for each course is limited.<br />Charles Dickens (Jr.), Dickens's Dictionary of London, 1879</div>
