He has traced the family back to Edward Reckitt of Gate Burton in Lincolnshire, a husbandman who died around 1650. His youngest son, Thomas Reckitt (d.1679), of Gate Burton had six children, the youngest of whom, Thomas Reckitt (1669-1724), married Susanna Turner in 1694 and had four children. The family were Quakers who lived within the area of the Gainsborough Monthly Meeting. The father went insane, spending some time in the Gainsborough house of correction while his wife and family were supported by the Gainsborough Friends. Susanna died young and the Friends continued to aid the children (Reckitt, William Reckitt, pp.1-8).<br />Their oldest surviving son, William Reckitt (1706-1769), was apprenticed by a Friend for a while and then set up as a weaver in the Wainfleet district and married Ellen Maw in 1731. They went on to have nine children though several of them did not survive childhood. In 1744 William Reckitt began a travelling ministry and in 1756 he embarked on a long journey across France and out to visit Friends in America and the West Indies before returning in 1760. From his experiences he wrote Some account of the Life and Gospel Labours of William Reckitt and editions of this contain printed copies of his letters home. The text contains detailed descriptions of the American colonies and is interesting for its anti-slavery content. In the West Indies he saw such cruelty that `it raised such a just indignation in my heart, that I used great freedom of speech sometimes in conversation'. Any contrition he encountered he took as a sign that `the Lord is rising...in judgement in the hearts of those negro keepers, shewing them the practice is evil'. William Reckitt made a second trip in 1764 during which his wife died. He returned to Lincolnshire and died himself in 1769 (Reckitt, William Reckitt, pp.9-49; Reckitt, Some account of the Life...of William Reckitt, pp.176-7).<br />One of William Reckitt's sons, Thomas Reckitt of Wainfleet (1741-1819), was Isaac Reckitt's father. He married Katherine Massey in 1772 and they had thirteen children, only seven of whom survived to adulthood. Isaac Reckitt was the fifth child and third son and he was born in 1792. His father was a successful grazier, having stayed at home to carry on his father's business while other family members followed him out to America on missionary work. Isaac took the lead from his own father, staying at home and conducting business though he seems to have inherited some of his grandfather's considerable energies. He and his older brother began a milling business in Boston and Isaac followed this with his own business in Nottingham in corn. The business records relate to this early activity. In 1840 he took over a small starch-making factory in Hull and founded Reckitt &amp; Sons (Reckitt, William Reckitt, p.49).<br />Reckitt &amp; Sons proved to be one of the most sucessful businesses in Hull in the last half of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century. Part of the reason for success was early diversification into black lead and washing blue manufacture. By 1851 Reckitts was one of the few large industrial units in Hull, employing 51 people and putting up a stand at the Great Exhibition of that year. Already more than half its workforce was made up of women, starting a tradition of being a big employer of female labour in Hull. During the next decade the workforce quadrupled in number to 210 employees (Bellamy, `Some aspects of the economy of Hull', I, pp.102, 112, 114, 127, 279, 280; Reckitt, The history of Reckitt and Sons Limited, passim).<br />In 1862 Isaac Reckitt died. He and his wife, Ann Coleby, whom he had married in 1819, had had seven children, two of whom had predeceased him. The firm was left equally to three of his sons, George (1825-1900), Francis (1827-1917) and James (1833-1924) and they in their turn brought three more sons in in 1898 to carry on into the twentieth century. This was a period of continued expansion and diversification, partly under the direction of T R Ferens who had started life as a clerk for James Reckitt and ended up as general manager from 1888. Offices were opened in London and New York, sometimes staffed by family members and the company branched into pharmaceuticals as a natural progression from producing disinfectants. In 1938 Reckitt's merged with J and J Colman Ltd. to form Reckitt and Colman Ltd. and the firm, originally started by a Quaker miller in 1840, is still an important employer in Hull over 150 years later. Through family members such as James Reckitt, the impact of this family firm also needs to be measured in cultural terms. The Reckitt family dominated the village life of Swanland for several decades, ensuring that there were no pubs until quite recently. Paternalistic welfare schemes ensured that Reckitt's workers were fed and housed and pensioned and Reckitt's Garden Village in East Hull produced an area with a self-contained identity with public buildings in classical style and vernacular architecture that was influenced by the arts and crafts movement (Reckitt, The history of Reckitt and Sons Limited, passim; Chapman-Huston, Sir James Reckitt, passim; Pevsner &amp; Neave, York and the East Riding, pp.563-4).<br /><b>Scope and Content<br /></b>This important small collection which records the early nineteenth century milling business of Isaac Reckitt, founder of Reckitt &amp; Sons in Hull in 1840, arrived as part of a larger deposit of miscellaneous items relating to the East Riding of Yorkshire from the British Records Association in the 1940s.<br />The papers give a quite comprehensive picture of the early mercantile and milling business of Reckitt in Boston, Lincolnshire, and later in Nottingham. They comprise six cash books covering the period 1818-1832; flour account books 1833-1838; bone account books 1830-1835; Reckitt's ledgers as a wool merchant in Boston 1830-1835 and as a corn factor at Nottingham 1834-1840; his sack account book as a miller at Nottingham 1833-1839; his shop acount book from Nottingham 1833-1840 and a few wheat and other accounts which post-date the setting up of Reckitt &amp; Sons in Hull, from the early 1850s.<br /><b>Further Information<br />Publication Note<br /></b>Bellamy, Joyce, `Some aspects of the economy of Hull in the nineteenth century with special reference to business history' (PhD, University of Hull, 1965)<br />Chapman-Huston, D, Sir James Reckitt: a memoir (1927)<br />Pevsner, Nikolaus &amp; Neave, David, The buildings of England: York and the East Riding (1995)<br />Reckitt, Basil N, A history of Sir James Reckitt charity (1981)<br />Reckitt, Basil N, A history of the Albert Reckitt charitable trust (1987)<br />Reckitt, Basil N, The history of Reckitt and Sons Limited (1958)<br />Reckitt, Basil N, William Reckitt: an eighteenth century Quaker transatlantic traveller (1989)<br />Reckitt, William, Some account of the Life and Gospel Labours of William Reckitt (1776)<br /><br />History of Reckitt and Colman<br /><a href="http://www.hullwebs.co.uk/content/l-20c/industry/reckitts/reckitts.htm">http://www.hullwebs.co.uk/content/l-20c/industry/reckitts/reckitts.htm</a><br /><br />Today, RECKITT &amp; COLMAN is a world leader in the manufacture and marketing of household, toiletry, food and pharmaceutical products. Starting with only 25 employees the company now employs worldwide over 25,000 people. Reckitt &amp; Colman's brands have become internationally renowned and are sold in over 40 countries. Its Canadian brands are not only familiar household names but many are also leaders in their categories. Examples include: Easy-Off Oven Cleaner, Zero Fine Fabric Wash, French's Mustard, Airwick and Wizard Air Fresheners, Sani Flush Toilet Bowl Cleaners, and Lysol Disinfectants. Of course, this wasn't always so...<br />It was over 150 years ago, back in 1840, in the city of Hull, in what is now the county of North Humberside, in England, that Isaac Reckitt founded what was to become Reckitt &amp; Colman.<br />Isaac Reckitt himself, was born in 1792 and had in fact established two previous businesses prior to this, both of which had failed! He was, however, a very determined man and the fact that he had now lost all his capital did not deter him. He borrowed money from his relatives and with it purchased a starch factory. His first business card simply read &quot;Isaac Reckitt Starch Manufacturer - late Middleton&quot; for he had purchased the business from Charles Middleton. The factory was situated in Dansom Lane, which today remains the location for the company's U.K. pharmaceuticals factory as well as its main U.K. office. Its headquarters and Board of Directors are located in Chiswick, London.<br />Whilst Isaac started the business, there was no development until his four sons became old enough to help. Indeed, it was Isaac's son Frederick who become the company's first chemist and his other son, George, its first salesman. From this point on the business was known as Reckitt &amp; Sons.<br />For the first nine years in <a href="http://www.hullwebs.co.uk/content/l-20c/industry/reckitts/reckitt-cronology.htm"><u><font color="#0000f6">the company's history</a></font></u>, the only product sold was starch. But by 1854 Reckitt &amp; Sons sold 22 products which competed in four product categories: starch, laundry blue, metal polish and washing paste. The company entered the pharmaceutical business in 1929 when they began the development of a liquid antiseptic that would not harm human skin. The leading brand on the market at that time was Lysol which was an excellent household disinfectant but was not designed to be used on skin. In 1932, Dettol antiseptic and disinfectant was launched and it became the company's biggest marketed in Canada. selling line. Little did they know that in just over 60 years the company would also come to own the Lysol brand!<br />During this time, the company began to expand its sales throughout England and to further diversify its product line into related areas. But despite this it took seven years for the company to make a profit! And it was a further eleven years before Isaac was able to pay off all his original loans. Unfortunately in 1862, only four years later, Isaac died at the age of 70.<br />Reckitt &amp; Sons also grew through the development of new markets. Its first export to a Dominion took place in 1864 when it sent laundry blue to Montreal, Canada. The Canadian market was developed through agents until finally a branch was opened in Vancouver and in 1924 a factory was acquired in Montreal. Today, factories and offices are still located throughout Canada with the Canadian Head Office in Etobicoke, Ontario.<br />Competition in these new markets was fierce and it was because of it that Reckitt decided to join forces with a company based in Norwich, England, by the name of J&amp;J Colman.<br /><br />Jeremiah Colman, like Isaac, was also from a family of millers. Jeremiah began milling mustard and flour in 1814. His diversification into starch and laundry blue took him into direct competition with Reckitt both at home and abroad. However, in 1913, the two decided to join the forces of their South American businesses. The partnership worked well and by 1921 they were working together in all their export markets until eventually, in 1938, they formed Reckitt &amp; Colman Ltd. Colman's expertise in the food industry was further enhanced by its purchase in 1903 of Keen, Robinson &amp; Co. manufacturers of food and soft drinks. The acquisition of the RT French company based in New York, U.S.A., which made food, mustard and spices was appropriate and it strengthened the company's presence in North America.<br />Keen's Mustard was one of the original brands marketed in Canada.<br />Today, Reckitt &amp; Colman continues to build on these solid foundations by concentrating on what it does best marketing a wide range of quality, strongly branded consumer products. Its vision is to be an outstanding global company with leading brands and exceptional people.<br />Reckitt &amp; Colman has continued to grow both through internal development of new products and the continuous improvement of existing lines. In order to fulfil its vision it has also pursued a strategy of acquisition to both strengthen its portfolio and its presence around the world. More recent purchases include: The Airwick Company in 1986 and with it the famous &quot;Magic Mushroom&quot; and &quot;Stick-Up&quot; products, Boyle-Midway in 1990 bringing with it many leading household brands and most recently, Lehn &amp; Fink in 1995 which added Lysol and Prosolve to the fold.<br />With these leading brands and Reckitt &amp; Colman's passion to be the best, it is well prepared to tackle the challenges of the 21st century.<br /><br />Current state of Reckitt Benckiser <br /><a href="http://www.successprinciplesonline.com/business-success-stories/business-success-story-reckitt-colman-the-making-of-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-household-products-maker/407.htm">http://www.successprinciplesonline.com/business-su...oducts-maker/407.htm</a><br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C106">106</a></span> Reckitt Francis of Butlers Court Beaconsfield Bucks died 25 Jan 1917 Probate London 28 March to Eliza Louisa Reckitt widow Francis William Reckitt esq Arthur Benington Reckitt esq and Arnold Reckitt captain HM Army.

A very distinguished late 19th century soldier, Arthur Grenfell lived there for nearly 5 years before leaving it to his younger brother, Francis Wallace Grenfell following his death in 1895. It then remained in his family until 1911 when it was sold to Francis Reckitt.<br />In 1940 it was used as a Red Cross Hospital for men of the Free French Navy. In 1956 it was purchased by the paper making firm Wiggins Teape to house their group research organisation until St James took ownership of the site.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1998">1998</a></span> Director and Joint Chairman of Reckitt and Sons.</div>
