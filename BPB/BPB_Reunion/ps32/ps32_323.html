<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Isaac Reckitt</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1998">1998</a></span> Educated at Joseph Crossfield&#8217;s School at Hartshill near Tamworth then apprenticed at Bury St. Edmunds to learn the corn trade.  In 1814 returned to Wainfleet to help his father and trade on his own account in wool.  Profits were small.  In 1818 with his older brother Thomas, he started in Skirbeck, on the outskirts of Boston, a joint milling venture each putting up L650, with additional help in loans from family.  Besides flour milling, the brothers dealt as merchants in grain and cereals of aill kinds.  In 1823 they installed mills for cement manufacture.  He married Ann Coleby bef 1819.  This marriage was very important as members of her family were of great help in supporting his businesses.  These included Robert Ransome of the firm of agricultural machinery manufacturers of Ipswich, Edward Gripper of Layer Breton Hall, Essex, who was a prosperous yeoman farmer, John Morland, an umbrella manufacturer, and John WIse of London.  <br /><br />Most of Isaac&#8217;s and Ann&#8217;s ch were born in Boston in a house in St. Ann&#8217;s Terrace.  The family is an essential part of the COmpany&#8217;s early history, for, whilst Isaac started the business, there was no development until his sons were old enough to help him and the ultimate success of the business was a combined affair.  <br /><br />The milling business did badly in 1827-33 and Isaac gave up his share to Thomas, who was insolvent in 1835.  Isaac had moved to Nottingham to start a new business as a corn factor.  The Nottingham venture 1833-40 involved much hard work and no profit.  He started looking for another business in Hull.  His br John lived there and his sister Sarah had married Nainy Kitching of Wainfleet who had moved to Hull.  So had other old Wainfleet friends, the Petchells, and they recommended his setting up as a broker and commission agent, and also reported a colour business for sale and a chance in Whalebone &#8220;which was done by one person and only one concern in Hull&#8221;.  At the same time Thomas R was looking for another possible joint venture, but he never found one and finally started a school in Manchester.  <br /><br />Who and by whom the starch business in Hull was suggested is not known... in July 1840 Isaac and his family moved from Nottingham to Hull ...  James was 7, Constance 3.  George was apprenticed near Bishop&#8217;s Stortford, Elizabeth was with her Ransome cousins in Essex, and Francis, aged 13, was at Ackworth.  Only Charles 21 was really old enough to help his father in his new venture but he was sickly and away at Newcastle as an apprentice.  Frederick was 18 and was probably of real help from the beginning.  <br /><br />Isaac then, in 1840, was a man of about 48 years of age, with a large and young family, who had come to try his fortune in Hull as a comparative stranger to it, after one serious failure as a miller in Boston (where he had lost all his capital) and after a second attempt in Nottingham to retrieve his fortunes (an attempt which had not been successful).  He evidently had persistence, for this was his third attempt, and was certainly possessed of an upright character, for the Society of Friends, who were very severe on members who failed in business, had not disowned him; indeed, he came of a family with a great tradition of service in the Quaker ministry.  He had no capital -- only what he could borrow from his relations -- but considerable business experience at home and abroad.  He had been in Holland and the Low Countries on a business trip before the Boston failure and he had also visited France and could speak French.  <br /><br />In 1840 Isaac bought a starch works from Charles Middleton of Hull, with capital (L621) loaned by his mother in law, sister, br John, brothers in law Edward Gripper, Robert Ransome, and John Morland, his cousin Wm Massey and his old friend Thomas Petchell.  <br /><br />The only product of the factory was starch made from wheat flour, and profits were thus very dependent on the price of corn.  A blue pigment, called smalts, was bought for whitening the starch and a little of it was sold independently of starch; it was the forerunner of ultramarine blue.  <br /><br />In 1841 the Works were flooded and Francis successfully begged to be allowed to come home from Ackworth School to save the wages of a labourer by working a pump himself.  He was 14 years old and stayed at home fro a year before apprenticeship in Newcastle.  <br /><br />Id Dec 1849 Isaac moved into the house in Williamson St,  which he and Ann were to occupy for the rest of their lives.  <br /><br />George started travelling in 1843 at 18.  Frank was apprenticed in Newcastle and he later went to Leiston Suffolk, whilst James was sent to Ackworth in Apr 1845. <br /><br />Frederick had developed a Soluble Starch ca 1846 which became the main product.  Starch from sago was sold starting in 1847.<br /><br />George became a partner in Jan 1848 (firm became Isaac Reckitt and Son).  Francis toyed with the idea of opening a London branch but it was decided he would travel in the North, leaving George to concentrate on the Midlands and South.  His salary was L31, going up to L90 in 1852.  the business started making a profit.Competition was intense from Brown and Poulson, Glenfield, ANderson and Colman.  The business absolutely depends on the participation of all three sons. James joins his brothers on the road in 1850.  Francis reports travelling in 3rd class trains and coaches.<br /><br />Photo of Francis facing p 16<br /><br />Francis urged emphasis on advertising in 1850.  Francis becomes a partner in 1852.  In 1857 he married Mary Ann Benington, the daughter of one of his customers in Stockton on Tees.  <br /><br />Reckitt and Sons Ltd, the private company, formed in 1879, taking over the assets of the partnership which had been called Isaac Reckitt and Sons in Hull and Reckitt and Sons in London.  Capital L200,000, shares all held by the family.  Directors were Francis, James and George, with Francis as first chairman alternating each year with James.  George remained in London.  <br /><br />Francis retired from active management in 1888 and gone south to live in Highgate London, but although not engaged in day-to-day management, he continued to exercise great influence on policy both at board meetings and by correspondence.  James bought Swanland Manor in 1894.<br /><br />Company went public as Reckitt and Sons Ltd in 1888.  The third generation started joining.  Several of Francis&#8217;s sons joined.  Arthur was secretary in 1893, then director.  Arnold was engineer to the works.  One son became an artist, two went to America (one was Ernest who was an accountant on his own and later becmae a director of the Reckitt branch out there) and one became an architect.  <br /><br />The most successful products were Starch, Blue and Black Lead.  Amalgamation with Colman&#8217;s and Keen Robinson&#8217;s was discussed in 1898.

He has traced the family back to Edward Reckitt of Gate Burton in Lincolnshire, a husbandman who died around 1650. His youngest son, Thomas Reckitt (d.1679), of Gate Burton had six children, the youngest of whom, Thomas Reckitt (1669-1724), married Susanna Turner in 1694 and had four children. The family were Quakers who lived within the area of the Gainsborough Monthly Meeting. The father went insane, spending some time in the Gainsborough house of correction while his wife and family were supported by the Gainsborough Friends. Susanna died young and the Friends continued to aid the children (Reckitt, William Reckitt, pp.1-8).<br />Their oldest surviving son, William Reckitt (1706-1769), was apprenticed by a Friend for a while and then set up as a weaver in the Wainfleet district and married Ellen Maw in 1731. They went on to have nine children though several of them did not survive childhood. In 1744 William Reckitt began a travelling ministry and in 1756 he embarked on a long journey across France and out to visit Friends in America and the West Indies before returning in 1760. From his experiences he wrote Some account of the Life and Gospel Labours of William Reckitt and editions of this contain printed copies of his letters home. The text contains detailed descriptions of the American colonies and is interesting for its anti-slavery content. In the West Indies he saw such cruelty that `it raised such a just indignation in my heart, that I used great freedom of speech sometimes in conversation'. Any contrition he encountered he took as a sign that `the Lord is rising...in judgement in the hearts of those negro keepers, shewing them the practice is evil'. William Reckitt made a second trip in 1764 during which his wife died. He returned to Lincolnshire and died himself in 1769 (Reckitt, William Reckitt, pp.9-49; Reckitt, Some account of the Life...of William Reckitt, pp.176-7).<br />One of William Reckitt's sons, Thomas Reckitt of Wainfleet (1741-1819), was Isaac Reckitt's father. He married Katherine Massey in 1772 and they had thirteen children, only seven of whom survived to adulthood. Isaac Reckitt was the fifth child and third son and he was born in 1792. His father was a successful grazier, having stayed at home to carry on his father's business while other family members followed him out to America on missionary work. Isaac took the lead from his own father, staying at home and conducting business though he seems to have inherited some of his grandfather's considerable energies. He and his older brother began a milling business in Boston and Isaac followed this with his own business in Nottingham in corn. The business records relate to this early activity. In 1840 he took over a small starch-making factory in Hull and founded Reckitt &amp; Sons (Reckitt, William Reckitt, p.49).<br />Reckitt &amp; Sons proved to be one of the most sucessful businesses in Hull in the last half of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth century. Part of the reason for success was early diversification into black lead and washing blue manufacture. By 1851 Reckitts was one of the few large industrial units in Hull, employing 51 people and putting up a stand at the Great Exhibition of that year. Already more than half its workforce was made up of women, starting a tradition of being a big employer of female labour in Hull. During the next decade the workforce quadrupled in number to 210 employees (Bellamy, `Some aspects of the economy of Hull', I, pp.102, 112, 114, 127, 279, 280; Reckitt, The history of Reckitt and Sons Limited, passim).<br />In 1862 Isaac Reckitt died. He and his wife, Ann Coleby, whom he had married in 1819, had had seven children, two of whom had predeceased him. The firm was left equally to three of his sons, George (1825-1900), Francis (1827-1917) and James (1833-1924) and they in their turn brought three more sons in in 1898 to carry on into the twentieth century. This was a period of continued expansion and diversification, partly under the direction of T R Ferens who had started life as a clerk for James Reckitt and ended up as general manager from 1888. Offices were opened in London and New York, sometimes staffed by family members and the company branched into pharmaceuticals as a natural progression from producing disinfectants. In 1938 Reckitt's merged with J and J Colman Ltd. to form Reckitt and Colman Ltd. and the firm, originally started by a Quaker miller in 1840, is still an important employer in Hull over 150 years later. Through family members such as James Reckitt, the impact of this family firm also needs to be measured in cultural terms. The Reckitt family dominated the village life of Swanland for several decades, ensuring that there were no pubs until quite recently. Paternalistic welfare schemes ensured that Reckitt's workers were fed and housed and pensioned and Reckitt's Garden Village in East Hull produced an area with a self-contained identity with public buildings in classical style and vernacular architecture that was influenced by the arts and crafts movement (Reckitt, The history of Reckitt and Sons Limited, passim; Chapman-Huston, Sir James Reckitt, passim; Pevsner &amp; Neave, York and the East Riding, pp.563-4).<br /><b>Scope and Content<br /></b>This important small collection which records the early nineteenth century milling business of Isaac Reckitt, founder of Reckitt &amp; Sons in Hull in 1840, arrived as part of a larger deposit of miscellaneous items relating to the East Riding of Yorkshire from the British Records Association in the 1940s.<br />The papers give a quite comprehensive picture of the early mercantile and milling business of Reckitt in Boston, Lincolnshire, and later in Nottingham. They comprise six cash books covering the period 1818-1832; flour account books 1833-1838; bone account books 1830-1835; Reckitt's ledgers as a wool merchant in Boston 1830-1835 and as a corn factor at Nottingham 1834-1840; his sack account book as a miller at Nottingham 1833-1839; his shop acount book from Nottingham 1833-1840 and a few wheat and other accounts which post-date the setting up of Reckitt &amp; Sons in Hull, from the early 1850s.<br /><b>Further Information<br />Publication Note<br /></b>Bellamy, Joyce, `Some aspects of the economy of Hull in the nineteenth century with special reference to business history' (PhD, University of Hull, 1965)<br />Chapman-Huston, D, Sir James Reckitt: a memoir (1927)<br />Pevsner, Nikolaus &amp; Neave, David, The buildings of England: York and the East Riding (1995)<br />Reckitt, Basil N, A history of Sir James Reckitt charity (1981)<br />Reckitt, Basil N, A history of the Albert Reckitt charitable trust (1987)<br />Reckitt, Basil N, The history of Reckitt and Sons Limited (1958)<br />Reckitt, Basil N, William Reckitt: an eighteenth century Quaker transatlantic traveller (1989)<br />Reckitt, William, Some account of the Life and Gospel Labours of William Reckitt (1776)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/21858/pages/975">http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/21858/pages/975</a><br />Patent granted to Isaac, George and Francis Reckitt, of Kingston upon Hull, being people called QUakers, for the invention of &#8220;improvements in the manufacture of start, British gum and Alze.&#8221; 1856</div>
