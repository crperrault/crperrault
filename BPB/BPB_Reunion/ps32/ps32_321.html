<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Ernest Reckitt</div>

<div class="psNotesData">I found this information in the 1900 census. The Reckitt family resided in WD 31 Chicago (Lake Township). The househild consisted of:<br />Ernest Reckitt, age 33, married 12 years, born England, immigrated 1889, occupation - expert (or export) account<br />Wife: Catherine, age 30, married 12 years, 4 children, 4 living, born England, immigrated 1889<br />Daughter: Dorothy, age 9, born Missouri<br />Son: Charles, age 7, born Illinois<br />Daughter: Ruth, age 5, born Illinois<br />Son: Francis, age 3, born Illinois<br />Sister-in-law: Florie Howard, age 15, born England<br />Servant: Mary Garrity<br /><br />Since Ernest &amp; Catherine were married 12 years, they must have married in England, prior to immigration in 1889. The presence of sister-in-law Florie Howard suggests Catherine's maiden name to be Howard.<br /><br />[Official Record of the Proceedings of the Congress of Accountants, held at the World&#8217;s Fair, St. Louis, 1904.]<br />In 1904, was with firm of Wilkinson, Reckitt and Williams.  <br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C1999">1999</a></span> [p 560] RECKITT, Ernest.  certified public accountant; born Hull, England OCt 8 1866; son of Francis and Mary Ann (Benington) Reckitt; ed; Oliver&#8217;s Mount School, Scarborough Eng; matriculated at London Univ Jun 1883; student Owens Coll of Victoria Univ Manchester, 1883-7, BS second on list, with first class honors, 1887; M.S. degree received later; post-grad course Univ of Gottingen 1887-8; married Catherine Ruth Howard of London, Jan 18 1890; children Florence H, Dorothy C, Charles E, Margaret Ruth and Francis B.

I was fearless or foolhardy when in the company of older boys, with the result that, on one occasion, I followed a bather, diving at the deep end of the bath, without any knowledge of swimming ; another time at school, seeing a boy swing himself off a high pole and alight on his feet, I tried the same and was carried into the house senseless. The school started with 11 boys, and grew to about 70. My son Malcolm was the youngest at the same school when Mr. Walton gave up. The premises in Belgrave Crescent were soon too small, and the school removed to Oliver's Mount, where, for some time, it was patronised by the boys from the principal families in the Society of Friends both in England and Ireland.<br />In 1867 the number of Thomas Walton's pupils increased so quickly that he bought a Hotel, known as the Princess Royal Hotel, altered the name to Oliver's Mount School, and when I left and went to York there were over 60 scholars.<br />The school afterwards passed into the hands of the Woodard Trust and became a successful girls' school, changing its name to Queen Margaret's.<br />At the age of 12 1/2 I passed on to Bootham School, York, for 3 1/2 years. Both schools encouraged study of Natural History and the exhibitions at the end of the year, of Fossils, Butterflies and Moths, Birds' Eggs and Pressed Flowers, were much ahead of most schools in the country.<br /><br /><span class="citation"><a href="../wc_src.html#C2002">2002</a></span> [Previts et al, The First CPAs] Ernest and Charles Coleby Reckitt were certified among the first group of CPAs in 1896<br /><br />Certificate 61 Ernest Reckitt, 62 Wall St, NY, 1866-??<br />Certificate 108 Charles Coleby Reckitt, 169 Jackso St, Chicago, 1864-1949<br />Harold Benington is not among them.<br /><br />TA Lee, THe development of the American public accountancy profession (p 38)<br />&#8220;Reckitt was a chemistry graduate and son [sic] of the founder of the chemical company now called Reckitt &amp; COleman.

Ernest Reckitt (UQ [CRP ie not a member of any UK professional society] and his brother, Charles Coleby Reckitt (UQ), started ERC [Ernest Reckitt and Co] following a year of employment with BWG in Chicago.  Ernest was  University of Manchester science graduate who came to the USA in 1890.  Charles was a lawyer who worked in real estate in the USA from 1883.  He remained with ERC until  moving to industry in 1902.  ERC&#8217;s initial employees from the US were, in 1906, Hugh Thornton Cuthbert (SAE, 1901) and Malcolm MacGregor (SAE, 1902).  <br /><br />[Barrow Wade and Guthrie (BWG) was founded in New York in 1883 as the US agency of Thomas, Wade and Guthrie (TWG) of London and Manchester.
